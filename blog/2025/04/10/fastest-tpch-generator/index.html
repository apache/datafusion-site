<p><strong>TLDR: TPC-H SF=100 in 1min using tpchgen-rs vs 30min+ with dbgen</strong>.</p>
<p>3 members of the <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a> community used Rust and open source
development to build <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs">tpchgen-rs</a>, a fully open TPC-H data generator over 20x
faster than any other implementation we know of.</p>
<p>It is now possible to create the TPC-H SF=100 dataset in 72.23 seconds (1.4 GB/s
ðŸ˜Ž) on a Macbook Air M3 with 16GB of memory, compared to the classic <code>dbgen</code>
which takes 30 minutes<sup>1</sup> (0.05GB/sec). On the same machine, it takes less than
2 minutes to create all 36 GB of SF=100 in <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> format, which takes 44 minutes using <a href="https://duckdb.org">DuckDB</a>.
It is finally convenient and efficient to run TPC-H queries locally when testing
analytical engines such as DataFusion.</p>
<p><img alt="Time to create TPC-H parquet dataset for Scale Factor  1, 10, 100 and 1000" class="img-responsive" src="/blog/images/fastest-tpch-generator/parquet-performance.png" width="80%"/></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Time to create TPC-H dataset for Scale Factor (see below) 1, 10,
100 and 1000 as 8 individual SNAPPY compressed parquet files using a 22 core GCP
VM with 88GB of memory. For Scale Factor(SF) 100 <code>tpchgen</code> takes 1 minute and 14 seconds and
<a href="https://duckdb.org">DuckDB</a> takes 17 minutes and 48 seconds. For SF=1000, <code>tpchgen</code> takes 10
minutes and 26 and uses about 5 GB of RAM at peak, and we could not measure
DuckDB&rsquo;s time as it <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/tpch.html#resource-usage-of-the-data-generator">requires 647 GB of RAM</a>, more than the 88 GB that was
available on our test machine. The testing methodology is in the
<a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/blob/main/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This blog explains what TPC-H is, how we ported the vintage C data generator to
Rust (yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4ri2gn/riir_rewrite_it_in_rust/">RWIR</a>) and optimized its performance over the course of a few weeks
of part-time work. We began this project so we can easily generate TPC-H data in
<a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a> and <a href="https://glaredb.com/">GlareDB</a>.</p>
<h1>Try it for yourself</h1>
<p>The tool is entirely open source under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs">tpchgen-rs repository</a> or try it for yourself by run the following commands after <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">installing Rust</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cargo install tpchgen-cli

# create SF=1 in classic TBL format
$ tpchgen-cli -s 1 

# create SF=10 in Parquet
$ tpchgen-cli -s 10 --format=parquet
</code></pre>
<h1>What is TPC-H / dbgen?</h1>
<p>The popular <a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpch/">TPC-H</a> benchmark (often referred to as TPCH) helps evaluate the
performance of database systems on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a> queries, the kind used to build BI
dashboards.</p>
<p>TPC-H has become a de facto standard for analytic systems. While there are <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p204-leis.pdf">well
known</a> limitations as the data and queries do not well represent many real world
use cases, the majority of analytic database papers and industrial systems still
use TPC-H query performance benchmarks as a baseline. You will inevitably find
multiple results for  &ldquo;<code>TPCH Performance &lt;your favorite database&gt;</code>&rdquo; in any
search engine.</p>
<p>The benchmark was created at a time when access to high performance analytical
systems was not widespread, so the <a href="https://www.tpc.org/">Transaction Processing Performance Council</a>
defined a process of formal result verification. More recently, given the broad
availability of free and open source database systems, it is common for users to
run and verify TPC-H performance themselves.</p>
<p>TPC-H simulates a business environment with eight tables: <code>REGION</code>, <code>NATION</code>,
<code>SUPPLIER</code>, <code>CUSTOMER</code>, <code>PART</code>, <code>PARTSUPP</code>, <code>ORDERS</code>, and <code>LINEITEM</code>. These
tables are linked by foreign keys in a normalized schema representing a supply
chain with parts, suppliers, customers and orders. The benchmark itself is 22
SQL queries containing joins, aggregations, and sorting operations.</p>
<p>The queries run against data created with <code><a href="https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen">dbgen</a></code>, a program
written in a pre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99">C-99</a> dialect, which generates data in a format called <em>TBL</em>
(example in Figure 2). <code>dbgen</code> creates data for each of the 8 tables for a
certain <em>Scale Factor</em>, commonly abbreviated as SF. Example Scale Factors and
corresponding dataset sizes are shown in Table 1. There is no theoretical upper
bound on the Scale Factor.</p>

<h1>Why do we need a new TPC-H Data generator?</h1>
<p>Despite the known limitations of the TPC-H benchmark, it is so well known that it
is used frequently in database performance analysis. To run TPC-H, you must first
load the data, using <code>dbgen</code>, which is not ideal for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must find and compile a copy of the 15+ year old C program (for example <a href="https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen">electrum/tpch-dbgen</a>)</li>
<li><code>dbgen</code> requires substantial time (Figure 3) and is not able to use more than one core.</li>
<li>It outputs TBL format, which typically requires loading into your database (for example, <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/507f6b6773deac69dd9d90dbe60831f5ea5abed1/datafusion/sqllogictest/test_files/tpch/create_tables.slt.part#L24-L124">here is how to do so</a> in Apache DataFusion) prior to query.</li>
<li>The implementation makes substantial assumptions about the operating environment, making it difficult to extend or embed into other systems.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Time to generate TPC-H data in TBL format" class="img-responsive" src="/blog/images/fastest-tpch-generator/tbl-performance.png" width="80%"/></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Time to generate TPC-H data in TBL format. <code>tpchgen</code> is
shown in blue. <code>tpchgen</code> restricted to a single core is shown in red. Unmodified
<code>dbgen</code> is shown in green and <code>dbgen</code> modified to use <code>-O3</code> optimization level
is shown in yellow.</p>
<p><code>dbgen</code> is so inconvenient and takes so long that vendors often provide
preloaded TPC-H data, for example <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/sample-data-tpch">Snowflake Sample Data</a>, <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/discover/databricks-datasets">Databricks Sample
datasets</a> and <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/tpch.html#pre-generated-data-sets">DuckDB Pre-Generated Data Sets</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to pre-generated datasets, DuckDB also provides a <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/tpch.html">TPC-H extension</a> 
for generating TPC-H datasets within DuckDB. This is so much easier to use than
the current alternatives that it leads many researchers and other thought
leaders to use DuckDB to evaluate new ideas. For example, <a href="https://github.com/lmwnshn">Wan Shen
Lim</a> explicitly <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14373">mentioned the ease of creating the TPC-H dataset</a> as one reason
the first student project of <a href="https://15799.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2025/">CMU-799 Spring 2025</a> used DuckDB.</p>
<p>As beneficial as the DuckDB TPC-H extension is, it is non-ideal for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates data in a proprietary format, which requires export to use in other systems.</li>
<li>Requires significant time (e.g. 17 minutes for Scale Factor 10).</li>
<li>Requires unnecessarily large amounts of memory (e.g. 71 GB for Scale Factor 10)</li>
</ol>
<p>The above limitations makes it impractical to generate Scale Factor 100 and
above on laptops or standard workstations, though DuckDB offers <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/tpch.html#pre-generated-data-sets">pre-computed
files</a> for larger factors<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<h1>Why Rust?</h1>
<p>Realistically we used Rust because we wanted to integrate the data generator
into <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a> and <a href="https://glaredb.com/">GlareDB</a>. However, we also believe Rust is
superior to C/C++ due to its comparable performance, but much higher programmer
productivity (Figure 4). Productivity in this case refers to the ease of
optimizing and adding multithreading without introducing hard to debug memory
safety or concurrency issues.</p>
<p>While Rust does allow unsafe access to memory (eliding bounds checking, for
example), when required for performance, our implementation is entirely memory
safe. The only <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aclflushopt%2Ftpchgen-rs%20unsafe&amp;type=code">unsafe</a> code is used to <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/blob/c651da1fc309f9cb3872cbdf71e4796904dc62c6/tpchgen/src/text.rs#L72">skip</a> UTF8 validation on known ASCII
strings.</p>

<h1>How: The Journey</h1>
<p>We did it together as a team in the open over the course of a few weeks.
<a href="https://github.com/lmwnshn">Wan Shen Lim</a> inspired the project by pointing out the benefits of <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14373">easy TPC-H
dataset creation</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14608#issuecomment-2651044600">suggesting we check out a Java port on February 11,
2025</a>. Achraf made <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/commit/53d3402680422a15349ece0a7ea3c3f001018ba0">first commit a few days later</a> on February 16, and <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/commit/9bb386a4c55b8cf93ffac1b98f29b5da990ee79e">Andrew
and Sean started helping on March 8, 2025</a> and we <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tpchgen/0.1.0">released version 0.1</a> on
March 30, 2025.</p>
<h2>Optimizing Single Threaded Performance</h2>
<p>Archaf <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/16">completed the end to end conformance tests</a>, to ensure correctness, and
an initial <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/12">cli check in</a> on March 15, 2025.</p>
<p>On a Macbook Pro M3 (Nov 2023), the initial performance numbers were actually
slower than the original Java implementation which was ported ðŸ˜­. This wasn&rsquo;t
surprising since the focus of the first version was to get a byte of byte
compatible port, and knew about the performance shortcomings and how to approach
them.</p>

<code>time target/release/tpchgen-cli -s $SCALE_FACTOR</code></p>
<p>With this strong foundation we began optimizing the code using Rust&rsquo;s low level
memory management to improve performance while retaining memory safely. We spent
several days obsessing over low level details and implemented a textbook like
list of optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/19">Avoiding startup overhead</a>,</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/62">Moving lookups from runtime</a> to load time</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing, single threaded performance is now 2.5x-2.7x faster than the initial version, as shown in Table 3.</p>

<h2>Multi-threading</h2>
<p>Then we applied <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html">Rust&rsquo;s fearless concurrency</a> &ndash; with a single, <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/commit/ab720a70cdc80a711f4a3dda6bac05445106f499">small PR</a> (272

and consume bounded memory using <a href="https://thenewstack.io/using-rustlangs-async-tokio-runtime-for-cpu-bound-tasks/">tokio for the thread scheduler</a><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 4, with this change, tpchgen-cli generates the full SF=100
dataset in 32 seconds (which is 3.3 GB/sec ðŸ¤¯). Further investigation reveals
that at SF=100 our generator is actually IO bound (which is not the case for
<code>dbgen</code> or <code>duckdb</code>) &ndash; it creates data <strong>faster than can be written to an SSD</strong>.
When writing to <code>/dev/null</code> tpchgen  generates the entire dataset in 25 seconds
(4 GB/s).</p>

<p>Using Rust and async streams, the data generator is also fully streaming: memory
use does not increase with increasing data size / scale factors<sup>5</sup>. The DuckDB
generator seems to <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/tpch.html#resource-usage-of-the-data-generator">require far more memory</a> than is commonly available on
developer laptops and memory use increases with scale factor. With <code>tpchgen-cli</code>
it is perfectly possible to create data for SF=10000 or larger on a machine with
16GB of memory (assuming sufficient storage capacity).</p>
<h2>Direct to parquet</h2>
<p>At this point, <code>tpchgen-cli</code> could very quickly generate the TBL format.
However, as described above, the TBL is annoying to work with, because</p>
<ol>
<li>It has no header</li>
<li>It is like a CSV but the delimiter is <code>|</code></li>
<li>Each line ends with an extra <code>|</code> delimiter before the newline ðŸ™„</li>
<li>No system that we know can read them without additional configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>We next <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/54">added support for CSV</a> generation (special thanks <a href="https://github.com/niebayes">@niebayes</a> from
Datalayers for finding and <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/issues/73">fixing</a> <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/issues/65">bugs</a>) which performs at the same
speed as TBL. While CSV files are far more standard than TBL, they must still be
parsed prior to load and automatic type inference may not deduce the types
needed for the TPC-H benchmarks (e.g. floating point vs Decimal).</p>
<p>What would be far more useful is a typed, efficient columnar format such as
Apache Parquet which is supported by all modern query engines. So we <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/71">made</a> a
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/tpchgen-arrow">tpchgen-arrow</a> crate to create <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> arrays directly and then <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/61">a small
300 line PR</a> to feed those arrays to the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/parquet">Rust Parquet writer</a>, again using
tokio for parallelized but memory bound work.</p>
<p>This approach was simple, fast and scalable, as shown in Table 5. Even though
creating Parquet files is significantly more computationally expensive than TBL
or CSV, tpchgen-cli creates the full SF=100 parquet format dataset in less than
45 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Table 5</strong>: <code>tpchgen-cli</code> Parquet generation performance measured with  <code>time
target/release/tpchgen-cli -s $SCALE_FACTOR --format=parquet</code></p>
<h1>Conclusion ðŸ‘ŠðŸŽ¤</h1>
<p>In just a few days, with some fellow database nerds and the power of Rust, we built something 10x better than what currently exists. We hope it inspires more research
into analytical systems using the TPC-H dataset and that people build awesome
things with it. For example, Sean has already added <a href="https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb/pull/3549">on-demand generation of
tables to GlareDB</a>. Please consider joining us and helping out at
<a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs">https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs</a>.</p>
<p>We met while working together on Apache DataFusion in various capacities. If you
are looking for a community of like minded people hacking on databases, we
welcome you to <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/communication.html">come join us</a>. We are in the process of integrating this into
DataFusion (see <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14608">apache/datafusion#14608</a>) if you are interested in helping ðŸŽ£</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><em>1</em>: Actual Time: <code>30:35</code></p>
<p><em>2</em>: It is possible to embed the dbgen code, which appears to be the approach taken by DuckDB. This approach was tried in GlareDB (<a href="https://github.com/GlareDB/glaredb/pull/3313">GlareDB/glaredb#3313</a>), but ultimately shelved given the amount of effort needed to adapt and isolate the dbgen code.</p>
<p><em>3</em>: It is pretty amazing to imagine the machine required to generate SF300 that had 1.8TB (!!) of RAM</p>
<p><em>4</em>: We tried to <a href="https://github.com/clflushopt/tpchgen-rs/pull/34">use Rayon (see discussion here)</a>, but could not easily keep memory bounded.</p>
<p><em>5</em>: <code>tpchgen-cli</code> memory usage is a function of the number of threads:  each thread needs some buffer space</p>
