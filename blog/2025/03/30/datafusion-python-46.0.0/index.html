<p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/datafusion/46.0.0/">datafusion-python 46.0.0</a> has been released. This release
brings in all of the new features of the core <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/03/24/datafusion-46.0.0">DataFusion 46.0.0</a> library. Since the last
blog post for <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/12/14/datafusion-python-43.1.0/">datafusion-python 43.1.0</a>, a large number of improvements have been made
that can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/tree/main/dev/changelog">changelogs</a>.</p>
<p>We highly recommend reviewing the upstream <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/03/24/datafusion-46.0.0">DataFusion 46.0.0</a> announcement.</p>
<h2>Easier file reading</h2>
<p>In these releases we have introduced two new ways to more easily read files into
DataFrames.</p>
<p>PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/982">#982</a> introduced a series of easier read functions for Parquet, JSON, CSV, and
AVRO files. This introduces a concept of a global context that is available by
default when using these methods. Now instead of creating a default Session
Context and then calling the read methods, you can simply import these read
alternative methods and begin working with your DataFrames. Below is an example of
how easy to use this new approach is.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datafusion.io import read_parquet
df = read_parquet(path="./examples/tpch/data/customer.parquet")
</code></pre>
<p>PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/980">#980</a> adds a method for setting up a session context to use URL tables. With
this enabled, you can use a path to a local file as a table name. An example
of how to use this is demonstrated in the following snippet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import datafusion
ctx = datafusion.SessionContext().enable_url_table()
df = ctx.table("./examples/tpch/data/customer.parquet")
</code></pre>
<h2>Registering Table Views</h2>
<p>DataFusion supports registering a logical plan as a view with a session context. This
allows creating views in one part of your work flow and passinng the session
context to other places where that logical plan can be reused. This is an useful
feature for building up complex workflows and for code clarity. PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1016">#1016</a> enables this
feature in <code>datafusion-python</code>.</p>
<p>For example, supposing you have a DataFrame called <code>df1</code>, you could use this code snippet
to register the view and then use it in another place:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ctx.register_view("view1", df1)
</code></pre>
<p>And then in another portion of your code which has access to the same session context
you can retrive the DataFrame with:</p>
<pre><code>df2 = ctx.table("view1")
</code></pre>
<h2>Asynchronous Iteration of Record Batches</h2>
<p>Retrieving a <code>RecordBatch</code> from a <code>RecordBatchStream</code> was a synchronous call, which would
require the end user's code to wait for the data retrieval. This is described in
<a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/issues/974">Issue 974</a>. We continue to support this as a synchronous iterator, but we have also added
in the ability to retrieve the <code>RecordBatch</code> using the Python asynchronous <code>anext</code>
function.</p>
<h2>Default ZSTD Compression for Parquet files</h2>
<p>With PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/981">#981</a>, we change the saving of Parquet files to use zstd compression by default.
Previously the default was uncompressed, causing excessive disk storage. Zstd is an
excellent compression scheme that balances speed and compression ratio. Users can still
save their Parquet files uncompressed by passing in the appropriate value to the
<code>compression</code> argument when calling <code>DataFrame.write_parquet</code>.</p>
<h2>UDF Decorators</h2>
<p>In PRs <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1040">#1040</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1061">#1061</a> we add methods to make creating user defined functions
easier and take advantage of Python decorators. With these PRs you can save a step
from defining a method and then defining a udf of that method. Instead you can
simply add the appropriate <code>udf</code> decorator. Similar methods exist for aggregate
and window user defined functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@udf([pa.int64(), pa.int64()], pa.bool_(), "stable")
def my_custom_function(
    age: pa.Array,
    favorite_number: pa.Array,
) -&gt; pa.Array:
    pass
</code></pre>
<h2><code>uv</code> package management</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> is an extremely fast Python package manager, written in Rust. In the previous version
of <code>datafusion-python</code> we had a combination of settings of PyPi and Conda. Instead, we
switch to using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> is our primary method for dependency management.</p>
<p>For most users of DataFusion, this change will be transparent. You can still install
via <code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code>. For developers, the instructions in the repository have been updated.</p>
<h2>Code cleanup</h2>
<p>In an effort to improve our code cleanliness and ensure we are following Python best
practices, we use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/">ruff</a> to perform Python linting. Until now we enabled only a portion
of the available linters available. In PRs <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1055">#1055</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1062">#1062</a>, we enable many more
of these linters and made code improvements to ensure we are following these
recommendations.</p>
<h2>Improved Jupyter Notebook rendering</h2>
<p>Since PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/839">#839</a> in DataFusion 41.0.0 we have been able to render DataFrames using html in
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> notebooks. This is a big improvement over the <code>show</code> command when we have the
ability to render tables. In PR <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/1036">#1036</a> we went a step further and added in a variety
of features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now html tables are scrollable, vertically and horizontally.</li>
<li>When data are truncated, we report this to the user.</li>
<li>Instead of showing a small number of rows, we collect up to 2 megabytes of data to
display. Since we have scrollable tables, we are able to make more data available
to the user without sacrificing notebook usability.</li>
<li>We report explicitly when the DataFrame is empty. Previously we would not output
anything for an empty table. This indicator is helpful to users to ensure their plans
are written correctly. Sometimes a non-output can be overlooked.</li>
<li>For long output of data, we generate a collapsed view of the data with an option
for the user to click on it to expand the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the below view you can see an example of some of these features such as the
expandable text and scroll bars.</p>

<h2>Extension Documentation</h2>
<p>We have recently added <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/python/contributor-guide/ffi.html">Extension Documentation</a> to the DataFusion in Python website. We
have received many requests about how to better understand how to integrate DataFusion
in Python with other Rust libraries. To address these questions we wrote an article about
some of the difficulties that we encounter when using Rust libraries in Python and our
approach to addressing them.</p>
<h2>Migration Guide</h2>
<p>During the upgrade from <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/43.0.0.md">DataFusion 43.0.0</a> to <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/dev/changelog/44.0.0.md">DataFusion 44.0.0</a> as our upstream core
dependency, we discovered a few changes were necessary within our repository and our
unit tests. These notes serve to help guide users who may encounter similar issues when
upgrading.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RuntimeConfig</code> is now deprecated in favor of <code>RuntimeEnvBuilder</code>. The migration is
fairly straightforward, and the corresponding classes have been marked as deprecated. For
end users it should be simply a matter of changing the class name.</li>
<li>If you perform a <code>concat</code> of a <code>string_view</code> and <code>string</code>, it will now return a
<code>string_view</code> instead of a <code>string</code>. This likely only impacts unit tests that are validating
return types. In general, it is recommended to switch to using <code>string_view</code> whenever 
possible. You can see the blog articles <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/09/13/string-view-german-style-strings-part-1/">String View Pt 1</a> and <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/09/13/string-view-german-style-strings-part-2/">Pt 2</a> for more information
on these performance improvements.</li>
<li>The function <code>date_part</code> now returns an <code>int32</code> instead of a <code>float64</code>. This is likely
only impactful to unit tests.</li>
<li>We have upgraded the Python minimum version to 3.9 since 3.8 is no longer officially
supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coming Soon</h2>
<p>There is a lot of excitement around the upcoming work. This list is not comprehensive, but
a glimpse into some of the upcoming work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusable DataFusion UDFs: The way user defined functions are currently written in
<code>datafusion-python</code> is slightly different from those written for the upstream Rust
<code>datafusion</code>. The core ideas are usually the same, but it means it takes effort for users
to re-implement functions already written for Rust projects to be usable in Python. Issue
<a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/issues/1017">#1017</a> addresses this topic. Work is well underway to make it easier to expose these
user functions through the FFI boundary. This means that the work that already exists in
repositories such as those found in the <a href="https://github.com/datafusion-contrib">datafusion-contrib</a> project can be easily
re-used in Python. This will provide a low effort way to expose significant functionality
to the DataFusion in Python community.</li>
<li>Additional table providers: We have work well underway to provide a host of table providers
to <code>datafusion-python</code> including: sqlite, duckdb, postgres, odbc, and mysql! In
<a href="https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-table-providers/issues/279">datafusion-contrib #279</a> we track the progress of this excellent work. Once complete, users
will be able to <code>pip install</code> this library and get easy access to all of these table
providers. This is another way we are leveraging the FFI work to greatly expand the usability
of <code>datafusion-python</code> with relatively low effort.</li>
<li>External catalog and schema providers: For users who wish to go beyond table providers
and have an entire custom catalog with schema, Issue <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/issues/1091">#1091</a> tracks the progress of exposing
this in Python. With this work, if you have already written a Rust based table catalog you
will be able to interface it in Python similar to the work described for the table
providers above.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only a sample of the great work that is being done. If there are features you would
