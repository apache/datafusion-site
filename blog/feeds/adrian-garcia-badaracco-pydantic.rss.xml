&lt;p&gt;This blog post introduces a powerful query engine optimization technique called dynamic filters or sideways information passing. We implemented this optimization in DataFusion as a community effort with care to support custom operators and distributed usage. These optimizations (and related work) have resulted in order of magnitude improvements for some â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adrian Garcia Badaracco (Pydantic)</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:datafusion.apache.org,2025-09-01:/blog/2025/09/01/dynamic-filters</guid><category>blog</category></item></channel></rss>
