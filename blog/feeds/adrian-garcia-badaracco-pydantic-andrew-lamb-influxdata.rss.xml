Intended Audience: Query engine / data systems developers who want to learn about topk optimization
Goal: Introduce TopK and dynamic filters as general optimization techniques for query engines, and how they were used to improve performance in DataFusion.
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post introduces the query engine optimization techniques called TopK
and dynamic filters. We describe the motivating use case, how these
optimizations work, and how we implemented them with the &lt;a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/"&gt;Apache DataFusion&lt;/a&gt;
community to improve performance by an order of magnitude for some query
patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
