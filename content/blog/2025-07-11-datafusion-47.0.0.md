[TOC]


<!-- see https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/16347 for details -->

We’re excited to announce the release of **Apache DataFusion 47.0.0**! This new version represents a significant
milestone for the project, packing in a wide range of improvements and fixes. You can find the complete details in the
full [changelog](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/branch-47/dev/changelog/47.0.0.md). We’ll highlight the most
important changes below and guide you through upgrading.

Note that DataFusion 47.0.0 was released in April 2025, but we are only now publishing the blog post due to 
limited bandwidth in the DataFusion community. We apologize for the delay and encourage you to come help us
accelerate the next release and announcements 
by [joining the community](https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/communication.html)  🎣.

## Breaking Changes

DataFusion 47.0.0 brings a few **breaking changes** that may require adjustments to your code as described in
the [Upgrade Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html#datafusion-47-0-0). Here are some notable ones:

- [Upgrades to arrow-rs and arrow-parquet 55.0.0 and object_store 0.12.0](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15466):
  Several APIs changed in the underlying `arrow`, `parquet` and `object_store` libraries to use a `u64` instead of usize to better support
  WASM. This requires converting from `usize` to `u64` occasionally as well as changes to ObjectStore implementations such as
```Rust
impl ObjectStore {
    ...

    // The range is now a u64 instead of usize
    async fn get_range(&self, location: &Path, range: Range<u64>) -> ObjectStoreResult<Bytes> {
        self.inner.get_range(location, range).await
    }
    
    ...
    
    // the lifetime is now 'static instead of '_ (meaning the captured closure can't contain references)
    // (this also applies to list_with_offset)
    fn list(&self, prefix: Option<&Path>) -> BoxStream<'static, ObjectStoreResult<ObjectMeta>> {
        self.inner.list(prefix)
    }
}
```
- [DisplayFormatType::TreeRender](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14914):
  Implementations of `ExecutionPlan` must also provide a description in the `DisplayFormatType::TreeRender` format to
  provide support for the new [tree style explains](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/explain.html#tree-format-default).
  This can be the same as the existing `DisplayFormatType::Default`.

## Performance Improvements

DataFusion 47.0.0 comes with numerous performance enhancements across the board. Here are some of the noteworthy
optimizations in this release:

- **`FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE`:**  `FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE` functions execute much faster for data with high cardinality such as those with many groups or partitions. DataFusion 47.0.0 executes the following in **7 seconds** compared to **36 seconds** in DataFusion 46.0.0: `select id2, id4, first_value(v1 order by id2, id4) as r2 from '~/h2o_100m.parquet' group by id2, id4` (h2o.ai dataset). (PR's [#15266](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15266)
  and [#15542](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15542) by [UBarney](https://github.com/UBarney)).

- **`MIN`, `MAX` and `AVG` for Durations:**  DataFusion executes aggregate queries up to 2.5x faster when they include `MIN`, `MAX` and `AVG` on `Duration` columns. 
  (PRs [#15322](  https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15322) and [#15748](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15748)
  by [shruti2522](https://github.com/shruti2522)).

- **Short circuit evaluation for `AND` and `OR`:** DataFusion now eagerly skips the evaluation of
  the right operand if the left is known to be false (`AND`) or true (`OR`) in certain cases. For complex predicates, such as those with many `LIKE` or `CASE` expressions, this optimization results in
  [significant performance improvements](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/11212#issuecomment-2753584617) (up to 100x in extreme cases).
  (PRs [#15462](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15462) and [#15694](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15694)
  by [acking-you](https://github.com/acking-you)).

- **TopK optimization for partially sorted input:** Previous versions of DataFusion implemented early termination
  optimization (TopK) for fully sorted data. DataFusion 47.0.0 extends the optimization for partially sorted data, which is common in many real-world datasets, such as time-series data sorted by day but not within each day. 
  (PR [#15563](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15563) by [geoffreyclaude](https://github.com/geoffreyclaude)).

- **Disable re-validation of spilled files:** DataFusion no longer does unnecessary re-validation of temporary spill files. The validation is unnecessary and expensive as the data is known to be valid when it was written out
  (PR [#15454](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15454) by [zebsme](https://github.com/zebsme)).

## Highlighted New Features

### Tree style explains

In previous releases the [EXPLAIN statement] results in a formatted table
which is succinct and contains important details for implementers, but was often hard to read
especially with queries that included joins or unions having multiple children.

[EXPLAIN statement]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/explain.html

DataFusion 47.0.0 includes the new `EXPLAIN FORMAT TREE` (default in
`datafusion-cli`) rendered in a visual tree style that is much easier to quickly
understand.

<!-- SQL setup 
create table t1(ti int) as values (1), (2), (3);
create table t2(ti int) as values (1), (2), (3);
-->

Example of the new explain output:
```sql
> explain select * from t1 inner join t2 on t1.ti=t2.ti;

Thanks to [irenjj](https://github.com/irenjj) for the initial work in PR [#14677](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/14677)
and many others for completing the [followup epic](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14914)

### SQL `VARCHAR` defaults to Utf8View

In previous releases when a column was created in SQL the column would be mapped to the [Utf8 Arrow data type]. In this release
the SQL `varchar` columns will be mapped to the [Utf8View arrow data type] by default, which is a more efficient representation of UTF-8 strings in Arrow.

[Utf8 Arrow data type]: https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/datatypes/enum.DataType.html#variant.Utf8
[Utf8View arrow data type]: https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/datatypes/enum.DataType.html#variant.Utf8View

```sql
create table foo(x varchar);
0 row(s) fetched.

> describe foo;
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| column_name | data_type | is_nullable |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| x           | Utf8View  | YES         |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
```

Previous versions of DataFusion used `Utf8View` when reading parquet files and it is faster in most cases.

### Context propagation in spawned tasks (for tracing, logging, etc.)

This release introduces an API for propagating user-defined context (such as tracing spans,
logging, or metrics) across thread boundaries without depending on any specific instrumentation library.
You can use the [JoinSetTracer] API to instrument DataFusion plans with your own tracing or logging libraries, or
use pre-integrated community crates such as the [datafusion-tracing] crate.

    />
    </a>
</div>


[datafusion-tracing]: https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-tracing

Previously, tasks spawned on new threads — such as those performing
repartitioning or Parquet file reads — could lose thread-local context, which is
often used in instrumentation libraries. A full example of how to use this new
API is available in the [DataFusion examples], and a simple example is shown below.


[JoinSetTracer]: https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/common/runtime/trait.JoinSetTracer.html
[DataFusion examples]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/datafusion-examples/examples/tracing.rs

```Rust
/// Models a simple tracer. Calling `in_current_span()` and `in_scope()` saves thread-specific state
/// for the current span and must be called at the start of each new task or thread.
struct SpanTracer;

/// Implements the `JoinSetTracer` trait so we can inject instrumentation
/// for both async futures and blocking closures.
impl JoinSetTracer for SpanTracer {
    /// Instruments a boxed future to run in the current span. The future's
    /// return type is erased to `Box<dyn Any + Send>`, which we simply
    /// run inside the `Span::current()` context.
    fn trace_future(
        &self,
        fut: BoxFuture<'static, Box<dyn Any + Send>>,
    ) -> BoxFuture<'static, Box<dyn Any + Send>> {
        // Ensures any thread-local context is set in this future 
        fut.in_current_span().boxed()
    }

    /// Instruments a boxed blocking closure by running it inside the
    /// `Span::current()` context.
    fn trace_block(
        &self,
        f: Box<dyn FnOnce() -> Box<dyn Any + Send> + Send>,
    ) -> Box<dyn FnOnce() -> Box<dyn Any + Send> + Send> {
        let span = Span::current();
        // Ensures any thread-local context is set for this closure
        Box::new(move || span.in_scope(f))
    }
}

...
set_join_set_tracer(&SpanTracer).expect("Failed to set tracer");
...
```
