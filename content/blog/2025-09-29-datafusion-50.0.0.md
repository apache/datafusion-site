## Performance Improvements üöÄ

> **üìùTODO** *Update chart*

DataFusion continues to focus on enhancing performance, as shown in the
ClickBench and other results.

**Figure 1**: ClickBench performance improvements over time Average and median
normalized query execution times for ClickBench queries for each git revision.
Query times are normalized using the ClickBench definition. Data and definitions
on the [DataFusion Benchmarking
Page](https://alamb.github.io/datafusion-benchmarking/).

Here are some noteworthy optimizations added since DataFusion 49:

**Dynamic Filter Pushdown Improvements**

The dynamic filter pushdown optimization, which allows runtime filters to cut
down on the amount of data read, has been extended to support **inner hash
joins**, dramatically improving the performance 
when one relation is relatively small or filtered by a highly selective
predicate. More details can be found in the
[Dynamic Filter Pushdown For Hash Joins](#dynamic-filter-pushdown-for-hash-joins) section below.

The dynamic filters in the TopK operator have also been
improved in DataFusion 50.0.0, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of
the optimization. More details can be found in this
[ticket](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16433).

**Nested Loop Join Optimization**

The nested loop join operator has been rewritten to reduce execution time and memory
usage by adopting a finer-grained approach. Specifically, we now limit the 
intermediate data size to around a single `RecordBatch` for better memory
efficiency, and we have eliminated redundant conversions from the old 
implementation to further improve execution speed.

When evaluating this new approach in a microbenchmark, we have measured up to 5x
improvements in execution time and 99% less memory usage. More details and
results can be found in this
[ticket](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16996).

**Parquet Metadata Caching**

The metadata from Parquet files, such as min/max statistics and page indexes, is
now cached to avoid unnecessary disk/network round-trips. This is especially
useful when querying the same table multiple times over relatively slow networks, allowing us to
achieve an order of magnitude faster execution time. More information can be
found in the [Parquet Metadata Cache](#parquet-metadata-cache) section.

## Community Growth  üìà

Between `49.0.0` and `50.0.0`, we continue to see our community grow:

2. In the [core DataFusion repo] alone, we reviewed and accepted 318 PRs
   from 79 different committers, created over 235 issues, and closed 197 of them
   üöÄ. All changes are listed in the detailed [changelogs].
3. DataFusion published several blogs, including *[Using External Indexes, Metadata Stores, Catalogs and
   Caches to Accelerate Queries on Apache Parquet]*.,  *[Dynamic Filters:
   Passing Information Between Operators During Execution for 25x Faster
   Queries]*, and *[Implementing User Defined Types and Custom Metadata 
   in DataFusion]*.

## New Features ‚ú®

### Improved Spilling Sorts For Larger-than-Memory Datasets

DataFusion has been able to sort datasets that do not fit entirely in memory for
a while, but still struggled with particularly large inputs or highly memory-constrained 
setups. Larger-than-memory sorts in DataFusion 50.0.0 have been improved with the recent introduction
of multi-level merge sorts (more details in the respective
[ticket](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15700)). It is now
possible to execute almost any sorting query that would have previously triggered *out-of-memory*
errors by relying on disk spilling.

### Dynamic Filter Pushdown For Hash Joins

The [dynamic filter pushdown
optimization](https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/09/10/dynamic-filters/)
has been extended to inner hash joins, dramatically reducing the amount of
scanned data in some workloads, a technique that is
sometimes referred to as [*Sideways information
passing*](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15721-f24/papers/Sideways_Information_Passing.pdf).

These filters are automatically applied on inner hash joins, while future work
will introduce them to other types. 

For example, given a query that looks for a specific customer and
their orders, DataFusion can now filter the `orders` relation based on the
`c_custkey` of the target customer, reducing the amount of data
read from disk by orders of magnitude.

```sql
-- retrieve the orders of the customer with c_phone = '25-989-741-2988'
SELECT *
FROM customer
JOIN orders on c_custkey = o_custkey
WHERE c_phone = '25-989-741-2988';
```

The following shows how
execution plans look in DataFusion 50.0.0 with this optimization:

```sql
HashJoinExec
    DataSourceExec: <-- read customer
      predicate=c_phone@4 = 25-989-741-2988
      metrics=[output_rows=1, ...]
    DataSourceExec: <-- read orders
      -- dynamic filter is added here, filtering directly at scan time
      predicate=DynamicFilterPhysicalExpr [ o_custkey@1 >= 1 AND o_custkey@1 <= 1 ]
      -- the number of output rows is kept to a minimum
      metrics=[output_rows=11, ...]
```

In previous versions of DataFusion, the entire `orders` relation would be
scanned to join with the target customer, but now the dynamic filter pushdown can
filter it right at the source, keeping the data loaded at a minimum.

More information can be found in the respective
[ticket](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16445), and 
the next step will be to [extend the dynamic filters to other types of
joins](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/16973), such as `LEFT` and
`RIGHT` outer joins. 

### Parquet Metadata Cache

The metadata of Parquet files (statistics, page indexes, ...) are now
automatically cached when using the built in [ListingTable], which reduces disk/network round-trips and repeated decoding
of the same information. With a simple microbenchmark that executes point reads
(e.g., `SELECT v FROM t WHERE k = x`) over large files, we measured a 12x
improvement in execution time (more details can be found in the respective
[ticket](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16971/)). This optimization is production ready and is enabled by default
(more details in the [Epic](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/17000)). 

[ListingTable]: https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/listing/struct.ListingTable.html


Here is an example of the metadata cache in action:

```sql
-- disabling the metadata cache
> SET datafusion.runtime.metadata_cache_limit = '0M';

-- simple query (t.parquet: 100M rows, 3 cols)
> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM 't.parquet' LIMIT 1;
DataSourceExec: ... metrics=[..., metadata_load_time=229.196422ms, ...]
Elapsed 0.246 seconds.

-- enabling the metadata cache
> SET datafusion.runtime.metadata_cache_limit = '50M';

> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM 't.parquet' LIMIT 1;
DataSourceExec: ... metrics=[..., metadata_load_time=228.612¬µs, ...]
Elapsed 0.003 seconds. -- 82x improvement in this specific query
```


The cache can be configured with the following runtime parameter:

```sql
datafusion.runtime.metadata_cache_limit
```

The default [`FileMetadataCache`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/execution/cache/cache_manager/trait.FileMetadataCache.html) uses a
*Least-recently-used* eviction algorithm, and up to 50MB of memory.
If the underlying file changes, the cache is automatically invalidated.
Setting the limit to 0 will disable
any metadata caching. As with most APIs in DatFusion, users can provide their own behavior using custom
[`FileMetadataCache`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/50.0.0/datafusion/execution/cache/cache_manager/trait.FileMetadataCache.html)
implementation when setting up the [`RuntimeEnv`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/execution/runtime_env/struct.RuntimeEnv.html).


For users with custom [`TableProvider`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/catalog/trait.TableProvider.html):

* If the custom provider uses the
[`ParquetFormat`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/file_format/parquet/struct.ParquetFormat.html), caching will work
without any changes

* Otherwise the
[`CachedParquetFileReaderFactory`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/physical_plan/parquet/struct.CachedParquetFileReaderFactory.html)
can be provided when creating a
[`ParquetSource`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/datasource/physical_plan/struct.ParquetSource.html).

  
Users inspect the cache contents through the
[`FileMetadataCache::list_entries`](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/execution/cache/cache_manager/trait.FileMetadataCache.html#tymethod.list_entries)
method and in `datafusion-cli`, you can use the
[`metadata_cache()`](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/functions.html#metadata-cache)
function:

```sql
> SELECT * FROM metadata_cache();
+---------------+-------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------+---------------------+------+-----------------+
| path          | file_modified           | file_size_bytes | e_tag                    | version | metadata_size_bytes | hits | extra           |
+---------------+-------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------+---------------------+------+-----------------+
| .../t.parquet | 2025-09-21T17:40:13.650 | 420827020       | 0-63f5331fb4458-19154f8c | NULL    | 44480534            | 27   | page_index=true |
+---------------+-------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------+---------------------+------+-----------------+
1 row(s) fetched.
Elapsed 0.003 seconds.
```


### `QUALIFY` Clause

The `QUALIFY` clause is now available in DataFusion
([#16933](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16933)). It allows window
function columns to be filtered without requiring a subquery (similarly to what
`HAVING` does for aggregations).

For example, this query:
```sql
SELECT a, b, c
FROM (
   SELECT a, b, c, rank() OVER(PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) as rk
   FROM t
)
WHERE rk = 1
```

can now be written like this:
```sql
SELECT a, b, c, rank() OVER(PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) as rk
FROM t
QUALIFY rk = 1
```

Although it is not a part of the SQL standard (yet), it has been gaining
adoption in several SQL analytical systems, such as DuckDB, Snowflake, and
BigQuery.

### `FILTER` Support for Window Functions

Keeping with the theme, the `FILTER` clause has been extended to support
[aggregate window functions](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17378).
This allows these functions to be applied to specific rows without having to
rely on `CASE` expressions, similar to what was already possible with regular
aggregate functions.


For example, you could gather multiple distinct sets of  values matching different criteria with a single pass over the input:

```sql
SELECT 
  ARRAY_AGG(c2) FILTER (WHERE c2 >= 2) OVER (...)        -- e.g. [2, 3, 4]
  ARRAY_AGG(CASE WHEN c2 >= 2 THEN c2 END) OVER (...)    -- e.g. [NULL, NULL, 2, 3, 4]
...
FROM table

### `ConfigOptions` Now Available to Functions

DataFusion 50.0.0 now allows User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to access the global
configuration parameters
([#16970](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16970)), allowing their
behavior to better suit users' workloads. As an example, time UDFs can now use
custom time zones instead of being limited to UTC.

### Added Several Spark functions

Finally, due to Apache Spark's impact on analytical processing, many DataFusion
users seek to use its functions in their workloads. Therefore, the new release
of DataFusion has added many such functions, namely:

- [`array`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16936)
- [`bit_get/bit_count`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16942)
- [`bitmap_count`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17179)
- [`crc32/sha1`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17032)
- [`date_add/date_sub`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17024)
- [`if`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16946)
- [`last_day `](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16828)
- [`like/ilike`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16962)
- [`luhn_check`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16848)
- [`mod/pmod`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16829)
- [`next_day`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16780)

- [`rint`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16924)
- [`width_bucket`](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17331)


## Upgrade Guide and Changelog

Upgrading to 50.0.0 should be straightforward for most users. Please review the
[Upgrade Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html)
for details on breaking changes and code snippets to help with the transition.
Recently, some users have reported success automatically upgrading DataFusion by
pairing AI tools with the upgrade guide. For a comprehensive list of all
changes, please refer to the [changelog].

## About DataFusion

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that uses
[Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast, data-centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
and machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion‚Äôs primary
design goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data-centric systems, it
provides a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe
library], [python library], and [command-line SQL tool].

DataFusion's core thesis is that, as a community, together we can build much
more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could do
alone. Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would
remain the domain of a few large companies and world-class research
institutions. With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation
and focus on what makes our projects unique.


## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors works together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us, we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests, or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here], and you
can find out how to reach us on the [communication doc].
