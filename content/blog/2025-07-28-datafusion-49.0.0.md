Here are some noteworthy optimizations added since DataFusion 48:

**Equivalence system upgrade:** The lower levels of the equivalence system, which is used to implement the
  optimizations described in [Using Ordering for Better Plans], were rewritten, leading to
  much faster planning times, especially for queries with a [large number of columns](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16217#pullrequestreview-2891941229). This change also prepares
  the way for more sophisticated sort-based optimizations in the future. (PR [#16217](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16217) by [ozankabak](https://github.com/ozankabak)).

**Dynamic Filters and TopK pushdown**

DataFusion now supports dynamic filters, which are improved during query execution,
and physical filter pushdown. Together, these features improve the performance of
queries that use `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` clauses, such as the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM data
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10
```

While the query above is simple, without dynamic filtering or knowing that the data
is already sorted by `timestamp`, a query engine must decode *all* of the data to
find the top 10 values. With the dynamic filters system, DataFusion applies an
increasingly selective filter during query execution. It checks the **current**
top 10 values of the `timestamp` column **before** opening files or reading
Parquet Row Groups and Data Pages, which can skip older data very quickly.

Dynamic predicates are a common feature of advanced engines such as [Dynamic
Filters in Starburst] and [Top-K Aggregation Optimization at Snowflake]. The
technique drastically improves query performance (we've seen over a 1.5x
improvement for some TPC-H-style queries), especially in combination with late
materialization and columnar file formats such as Parquet. We [plan to write a
blog post] explaining the details of this optimization in the future, and we expect to
use the same mechanism to implement additional optimizations such as [Sideways
Information Passing for joins] (Issue
[#15037](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/15037) PR
[#15770](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15770) by
[adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)).

## New Features ✨

### Async User-Defined Functions

It is now possible to write `async` User-Defined Functions
(UDFs) in DataFusion that perform asynchronous
operations, such as network requests or database queries, without blocking the
execution of the query. This enables new use cases, such as
integrating with large language models (LLMs) or other external services, and we can't
wait to see what the community builds with it.

See the [documentation] for more details and the [async UDF example] for
working code. 

[documentation]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/functions/adding-udfs.html
[async UDF example]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/datafusion-examples/examples/async_udf.rs

You could, for example, implement a function `ask_llm` that asks a large language model
(LLM) service a question based on the content of two columns.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM animal a
WHERE ask_llm(a.name, 'Is this animal furry?')")
```

The implementation of an async UDF is almost identical to a normal
UDF, except that it must implement the `AsyncScalarUDFImpl` trait in addition to `ScalarUDFImpl` and
provide an `async` implementation via `invoke_async_with_args`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct AskLLM {
    signature: Signature,
}

#[async_trait]
impl AsyncScalarUDFImpl for AskLLM {
    /// The `invoke_async_with_args` method is similar to `invoke_with_args`,
    /// but it returns a `Future` that resolves to the result.
    ///
    /// Since this signature is `async`, it can do any `async` operations, such
    /// as network requests.
    async fn invoke_async_with_args(
        &self,
        args: ScalarFunctionArgs,
        options: &ConfigOptions,
    ) -> Result<ArrayRef> {
        // Converts the arguments to arrays for simplicity.
        let args = ColumnarValue::values_to_arrays(&args.args)?;
        let [column_of_interest, question] = take_function_args(self.name(), args)?;
        let client = Client::new();

        // Make a network request to a hypothetical LLM service
        let res = client
            .post(URI)
            .headers(get_llm_headers(options))
            .json(&req)
            .send()
            .await?
            .json::<LLMResponse>()
            .await?;
        
        let results = extract_results_from_llm_response(&res);
        
        Ok(Arc::new(results))
    }
}
```

### Better Cancellation for Certain Long-Running Queries

In rare cases, it was previously not possible to cancel long-running queries,
leading to unresponsiveness. Other projects would likely have fixed this issue
by treating the symptom, but [pepijnve] and the DataFusion community worked together to
treat the root cause. The general solution required a deep understanding of the
DataFusion execution engine, Rust `Streams`, and the tokio cooperative
scheduling model. The [resulting PR] is a model of careful
community engineering and a great example of using Rust's `async` ecosystem
to implement complex functionality. It even resulted in a [contribution upstream to tokio]
(since accepted). See the [blog post] for more details.

### Metadata for User Defined Types such as `Variant` and `Geometry`

User-defined types have been [a long-requested feature], and this release provides
the low-level APIs to support them efficiently.

1. Metadata handling in PRs [#15646](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15646) and [#16170](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16170) from [timsaucer]
2. Pushdown of filters and expressions (see "Dynamic Filters and TopK pushdown" section above)

[a long-requested feature]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/12644
[timsaucer]:  https://github.com/timsaucer

We still have some work to do to fully support user-defined types, specifically
in documentation and testing, and we would
love your help in this area. If you are interested in contributing,
please see [issue #12644](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/12644).

### Parquet Modular Encryption

DataFusion now supports reading and writing encrypted [Apache Parquet] files with [modular
encryption]. This allows users to encrypt specific columns in a Parquet file
using different keys, while still being able to read data without needing to
decrypt the entire file.

[Apache Parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/
[modular encryption]: https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encryption/

Here is an example of how to configure DataFusion to read an encrypted Parquet
table with two columns, `double_field` and `float_field`, using modular
encryption:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE encrypted_parquet_table
(
double_field double,
float_field float
)
STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION 'pq/' OPTIONS (
    -- encryption
    'format.crypto.file_encryption.encrypt_footer' 'true',
    'format.crypto.file_encryption.footer_key_as_hex' '30313233343536373839303132333435',  -- b"0123456789012345"
    'format.crypto.file_encryption.column_key_as_hex::double_field' '31323334353637383930313233343530', -- b"1234567890123450"
    'format.crypto.file_encryption.column_key_as_hex::float_field' '31323334353637383930313233343531', -- b"1234567890123451"
    -- decryption
    'format.crypto.file_decryption.footer_key_as_hex' '30313233343536373839303132333435', -- b"0123456789012345"
    'format.crypto.file_decryption.column_key_as_hex::double_field' '31323334353637383930313233343530', -- b"1234567890123450"
    'format.crypto.file_decryption.column_key_as_hex::float_field' '31323334353637383930313233343531', -- b"1234567890123451"
);
```

[PR #16351](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16351)
from [corwinjoy](https://github.com/corwinjoy) and [adamreeve](https://github.com/adamreeve))


### Support for `WITHIN GROUP` for Ordered-Set Aggregate Functions

DataFusion now supports the `WITHIN GROUP` clause for [ordered-set aggregate
functions] such as `approx_percentile_cont`, `percentile_cont`, and
`percentile_disc`, which allows users to specify the precise order.

For example, the following query computes the 50th percentile for the `temperature` column
in the `city_data` table, ordered by `date`:

```sql
SELECT
	percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY date) AS median_temperature
FROM city_data;
```

PR [#13511](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/13511),
by [Garamda](https://github.com/Garamda))

### Compressed Spill Files

DataFusion now supports compressing the files written to disk when spilling
larger-than-memory datasets while sorting and grouping. Using compression
can significantly reduce the
size of the intermediate files and improve performance when reading them back into memory.

(Issue [#16130](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/16130),
PR [#16268](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16268)
by [ding-young](https://github.com/ding-young))

### Support for `REGEX_INSTR` function

DataFusion now supports the [`REGEXP_INSTR` function], which returns the position of a
regular expression match within a string.

For example, to find the position of the first match of the regular expression
`C(.)(..)` in the string `ABCDEF`, you can use:

```sql
> SELECT regexp_instr('ABCDEF', 'C(.)(..)');
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| regexp_instr(Utf8("ABCDEF"),Utf8("C(.)(..)"))                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## About DataFusion

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast, data-centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
and machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion’s primary design
goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data-centric systems, it provides a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library],
[python library], and [command-line SQL tool].

[apache datafusion]: https://datafusion.apache.org/
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[apache arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org
[DataFusion’s primary design goal]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals
[dataframe library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/dataframe.html
[python library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/python/
[command line SQL tool]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/

DataFusion's core thesis is that as a community, together we can build much more
advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could do alone.
Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would remain
the domain of a few large companies and world-class research institutions.
With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation and focus on
what makes our projects unique.


## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors works together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us, we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests, or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here], and you
can find out how to reach us on the [communication doc].
