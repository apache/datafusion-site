## Performance Improvements 🚀
We continue to make significant performance improvements in DataFusion, both in
the core engine and in the Parquet reader.

Query times are normalized using the ClickBench definition. See the
[DataFusion Benchmarking Page](https://alamb.github.io/datafusion-benchmarking/)
for more details.

### Faster `CASE` expression evaluation

This release builds on the [CASE performance epic] with significant improvements.
Expressions short‑circuit earlier, reuse partial results, and avoid unnecessary
scattering, speeding up common ETL patterns. Thanks to [pepijnve], [chenkovsky],
and [petern48] for leading this effort. We hope to share more details on our
implementation in a future post.

**Fewer object store round-trips for Parquet by default**

DataFusion now sets a default `metadata_size_hint` for [Apache Parquet] scans
([#18118]), avoiding the extra
“last 8‑byte” request many clouds require to read file footers. Remote scans
typically drop from five requests to four per file, cutting latency and transfer
costs without any application changes. Thanks to [zhuqi-lucas] for leading this
effort.

### Faster Parquet metadata parsing

DataFusion 51 also includes the latest Parquet reader from
[Arrow Rust 57.0.0], which parses Parquet metadata significantly faster. This is
especially beneficial for workloads with many small Parquet files and scenarios
where startup time or low latency is important. You can read more about the upstream work by
[etseidl] and [jhorstmann] that enabled these improvements in the [Faster Apache Parquet Footer Metadata Using a Custom Thrift Parser] blog.

### Better Defaults for Remote Parquet Reads

By default, DataFusion now fetches the last 512KB (configurable) of Parquet files
so the first request usually includes the full footer ([#18118]). This will
typically avoid two distinct I/O requests for each Parquet file. While this
setting has existed in DataFusion for many years, it was not previously enabled
by default. Users can tune the number of bytes fetched in the initial I/O
request via the `datafusion.execution.parquet.metadata_size_hint` [config setting]. Thanks to
[zhuqi-lucas] for leading this effort.

## New Features ✨

### Decimal32/Decimal64 support

The new Arrow types `Decimal32` and `Decimal64` are now supported in DataFusion
([#17501]), including aggregations such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN/MAX`, and window
functions. Thanks to [AdamGS] for leading this effort.


### SQL Pipe Operators

DataFusion now supports the SQL pipe operator syntax
([#17278]), enabling inline transforms such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t
|> WHERE a > 10
|> ORDER BY b
|> LIMIT 5;
```

This syntax, [popularized by Google BigQuery], keeps multi-step transformations concise while preserving regular
SQL semantics. Thanks to [simonvandel] for leading this effort.

[popularized by Google BigQuery]: https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/pipe-syntax

### I/O Profiling in `datafusion-cli`

[datafusion-cli] now has built-in instrumentation to trace object store calls
([#17207]). Toggle profiling
with the [\object_store_profiling command] and inspect the exact `GET`/`LIST` requests issued during
query execution:

[datafusion-cli]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/
[\object_store_profiling command]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/usage.html#commands

```sql
DataFusion CLI v51.0.0
> \object_store_profiling trace
ObjectStore Profile mode set to Trace
> select count(*) from 'https://datasets.clickhouse.com/hits_compatible/athena_partitioned/hits_1.parquet';
+----------+

+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
```

This makes it far easier to diagnose slow remote scans and validate caching
strategies. Thanks to [BlakeOrth] for leading this effort.

### `DESCRIBE <query>`

`DESCRIBE` now works on arbitrary queries, returning the schema instead
of being an alias for `EXPLAIN` ([#18234](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18234)). This brings DataFusion in line with engines
like DuckDB and makes it easy to inspect the output schema of queries
without executing them. Thanks to [djanderson] for leading this effort.

For example:

```sql
DataFusion CLI v51.0.0
> create table t(a int, b varchar, c float) as values (1, 'a', 2.0);
0 row(s) fetched.
Elapsed 0.002 seconds.

> DESCRIBE SELECT a, b, SUM(c) FROM t GROUP BY a, b;

+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| column_name | data_type | is_nullable |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| a           | Int32     | YES         |
| b           | Utf8View  | YES         |
| sum(t.c)    | Float64   | YES         |
+-------------+-----------+-------------+
3 row(s) fetched.
```


### Named arguments in SQL functions

DataFusion now understands [PostgreSQL-style named arguments] (`param => value`)
for scalar, aggregate, and window functions ([#17379](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/17379)). You can mix positional and named
arguments in any order, and error messages now list parameter names to make
diagnostics clearer. UDF authors can also expose parameter names so their
functions benefit from the same syntax. Thanks to [timsaucer] and [bubulalabu] for leading this effort.

[PostgreSQL-style named arguments]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-calling-funcs.html

For example, you can pass arguments to functions like this:
```sql
SELECT power(exponent => 3.0, base => 2.0);
```

### Metrics improvements

The output of [EXPLAIN ANALYZE] has been improved to include more metrics
about execution time and memory usage of each operator ([#18217]).
You can learn more about these new metrics in the [metrics user guide]. Thanks to
[2010YOUY01] for leading this effort.


[#18217]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18217
[2010YOUY01]: https://github.com/2010YOUY01

The `51.0.0` release adds:

- **Configuration**: adds a new option `datafusion.explain.analyze_level`, which can be set to `summary` for a concise output or `dev` for the full set of metrics (the previous default).
- **For all major operators**: adds `output_bytes`, reporting how many bytes of data each operator produces.
- **FilterExec**: adds a `selectivity` metric (`output_rows / input_rows`) to show how effective the filter is.
- **AggregateExec**: 
  - adds detailed timing metrics for group-ID computation, aggregate argument evaluation, aggregation work, and emitting final results.
  - adds a `reduction_factor` metric (`output_rows / input_rows`) to show how much grouping reduces the data.
- **NestedLoopJoinExec**: adds a `selectivity` metric (`output_rows / (left_rows * right_rows)`) to show how many combinations actually pass the join condition.
- Several display formatting improvements were added to make `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output easier to read.

[EXPLAIN ANALYZE]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/explain.html#explain-analyze
[metrics user guide]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/metrics.html

For example, the following query:
```sql
set datafusion.explain.analyze_level = summary

explain analyze 
select count(*) 
from 'https://datasets.clickhouse.com/hits_compatible/athena_partitioned/hits_1.parquet' 
where "URL" <> '';
```

Now shows easier-to-understand metrics such as:

```text
 metrics=[
   output_rows=1000000, 
   elapsed_compute=16ns, 
   output_bytes=222.5 MB, 
   files_ranges_pruned_statistics=16 total → 16 matched, 
   row_groups_pruned_statistics=3 total → 3 matched, 
   row_groups_pruned_bloom_filter=3 total → 3 matched, 
   page_index_rows_pruned=0 total → 0 matched,
   bytes_scanned=33661364,
   metadata_load_time=4.243098ms, 
]
```

## About DataFusion

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that uses
[Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast, data-centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
and machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion’s primary
design goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data-centric systems, it
provides a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe
library], [Python library], and [command-line SQL tool].

DataFusion's core thesis is that, as a community, together we can build much
more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could build
alone. Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would
remain the domain of a few large companies and world-class research
institutions. With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation
and focus on what makes our projects unique.

## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors works together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us, we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests, or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here], and you
can find out how to reach us on the [communication doc].
