## Introduction

We are proud to announce the release of [DataFusion 51.0.0]. This post highlights
some of the major improvements since [DataFusion 50.0.0]. The complete list of
changes is available in the [changelog]. Thanks to [numerous contributors] for
making this release possible!

## Performance Improvements 🚀

**Faster `CASE` expressions**

A series of optimizer and execution changes (see the
[CASE performance epic](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18075))
significantly reduces work when evaluating complex `CASE` branches. Expressions
short‑circuit earlier, reuse partial results, and avoid unnecessary scattering,
speeding up common ETL patterns.

**Fewer object store round-trips for Parquet**

DataFusion now sets a default `metadata_size_hint` for Parquet scans
([#18118](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18118)), avoiding the extra
“last 8‑byte” request many clouds require to read file footers. Remote scans
typically drop from five requests to four per file, cutting latency and transfer
costs without any application changes.

## New Features ✨

### Decimal32/Decimal64 Everywhere

DataFusion now treats the smaller decimal types as first-class citizens
([#17501](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17501)). Aggregations like
`SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN/MAX`, and window functions work seamlessly with `Decimal32`
and `Decimal64`, removing a common source of “type not supported” errors for
financial and sensor workloads.

### SQL Pipe Operators

Pipe operators from sqlparser are now executable in DataFusion
([#17278](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/17278)), enabling inline
transforms such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t
|> WHERE a > 10
|> ORDER BY b
|> LIMIT 5;
```

This syntax keeps multi-step transformations concise while preserving regular
SQL semantics.

### Object Store Profiling in `datafusion-cli`

The CLI gained built-in instrumentation to trace object store calls
([#17207](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/17207)). Toggle profiling
with a single command and inspect the exact `GET`/`LIST` requests issued during
query execution:

```sql
> \\object_store_profiling trace
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 'https://datasets.clickhouse.com/.../hits_1.parquet';
-- trace output includes operation, range, size, path, and duration
```

This makes it far easier to diagnose slow remote scans and validate caching
strategies.

### Better Defaults for Remote Parquet Reads

Alongside the new profiling tools, DataFusion now uses a larger default Parquet
footer prefetch hint so the first request usually includes the full footer
([#18118](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18118)). Users can tune it
via `datafusion.execution.parquet.metadata_size_hint`, and disable prefetching
by setting it to `0`.

## Upgrade Guide and Changelog

Upgrading to 51.0.0 should be straightforward for most users. Please review the
[Upgrade Guide](https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/upgrading.html)
for details on breaking changes and code snippets to help with the transition.
For a comprehensive list of all changes, please refer to the [changelog].

## About DataFusion

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that uses
[Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast, data-centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
and machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion’s primary
design goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data-centric systems, it
provides a reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe
library], [Python library], and [command-line SQL tool].

[command-line SQL tool]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/

DataFusion's core thesis is that, as a community, together we can build much
more advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could build
alone. Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would
remain the domain of a few large companies and world-class research
institutions. With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation
and focus on what makes our projects unique.

## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors works together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us, we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests, or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here], and you
can find out how to reach us on the [communication doc].
