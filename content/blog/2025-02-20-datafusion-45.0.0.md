## Introduction

We are very proud to announce [DataFusion 45.0.0]. This blog highlights some of the
many major improvements since we released [DataFusion 40.0.0] and a preview of
what the community is thinking about in the next 6 months. It has been an exciting
period of development for DataFusion!

[DataFusion 40.0.0]: https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/07/24/datafusion-40.0.0/
[DataFusion 45.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/45.0.0

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusionâ€™s primary design
goal] is to accelerate the creation of other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library],
[python library] and [command line SQL tool].

[apache datafusion]: https://datafusion.apache.org/
[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/
[apache arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org
[DataFusionâ€™s primary design goal]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals
[dataframe library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/dataframe.html
[python library]: https://datafusion.apache.org/python/
[command line SQL tool]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/

DataFusion's core thesis is that as a community, together we can build much more
advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could do alone. 
Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would remain
the domain of a few large companies and world-class research institutions. 
With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation, and focus on
what makes our projects unique.


## Community Growth  ðŸ“ˆ 

In the last 6 months, between `40.0.0` and `45.0.0`, our community continues to
grow in new and exciting ways.

1. We added several PMC members and new committers: [@jayzhan211] and [@jonahgao] joined the PMC,
   [@2010YOUY01], [@rachelint], [@findpi], [@iffyio], [@goldmedal], [@Weijun-H], [@Michael-J-Ward] and [@korowa]
   joined as committers. See the [mailing list] for more details.
2. In the [core DataFusion repo] alone we reviewed and accepted almost 1600 PRs from 206 different
   committers, created over 1100 issues and closed 751 of them ðŸš€. All changes are listed in the detailed
   [changelogs].
3. DataFusion focused meetups happened in multiple cities around the world: [Hangzhou], [Belgrade], [New York], 
   [Seattle], [Chicago], [Boston] and [Amsterdam] as well as a Rust NYC meetup in NYC focused on DataFusion.

DataFusion has put in an application to be part of [Google Summer of Code] with a 
[number of ideas] for projects with mentors already selected. Additionally, [some ideas] on
how to make DataFusion an ideal selection for university database projects such as the 
[CMU database classes] have been put forward.

In addition, DataFusion has been appearing publicly more and more, both online and offline. Here are some highlights:

1. A [demonstration of how uwheel] is integrated into DataFusion
2. Integrating StringView into DataFusion - [part 1] and [part 2]
3. [Building streams] with DataFusion
4. [Caching in DataFusion]: Don't read twice
5. [Parquet pruning in DataFusion]: Read no more than you need
6. DataFusion is one of [The 10 coolest open source software tools]
7. [Building databases over a weekend]

## Improved Performance ðŸš€ 

DataFusion hit a milestone in its development by becoming [the fastest single node engine] 
for querying Apache Parquet files in [clickbench] benchmark for the 43.0.0 release. A [lot 
of work] went into making this happen! While other engines have subsequently gotten faster,
displacing DataFusion from the top spot, DataFusion still remains near the top and we [are planning
more improvements].

/>

**Figure 1**: ClickBench performance improved over 33% between DataFusion 33
(released Nov. 2023) and DataFusion 45 (released Feb. 2025). 

The task of [integrating] the new [Arrow StringView] which significantly improves performance 
for workloads that scan, filter and group by variable length string and binary data was completed 
and enabled by default in the past 6 months. The improvement is especially pronounced for Parquet 
files due to [upstream work in the parquet reader]. Kudos to [@XiangpengHong], [@AriesDevil], 
[@PsiACE], [@Weijun-H], [@a10y], and [@RinChanNOWWW] for driving this project.

## Improved Quality ðŸ“‹

DataFusion continues to improve overall in quality. In addition to ongoing bug
fixes, one of the most exciting improvements in the last 6 months was the addition of the 
[SQLite sqllogictest suite] thanks to [@Omega359]. These tests run over 5 million 
sql statements on every push to the main branch.

Support for [explicitly checking logical plan invariants] was added by [@wiedld] which 
can help catch implicit changes that might cause problems during upgrades.

We have also started other quality initiatives to make it [easier to use DataFusion] 
based on [GlareDB]'s experience along with more [extensive prerelease testing].

## Improved Documentation ðŸ“š

We continue to improve the documentation to make it easier to get started using DataFusion. 
During the last 6 months two projects were initiated to migrate the function documentation
from strictly static markdown files. First, [@Omega359] [created a framework] to allow function
documentation to be generated from code and [@jonathanc-n] and others helped with the migration,
then [@comphead] lead a project to [create a doc macro] to allow for an even easier way to write 
function documentation. A special thanks to [@Chen-Yuan-Lai] for migrating many functions to 
the new syntax.

[created a framework]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/12668
[create a doc macro]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/12822

Additionally, the [examples] were [refactored] and [cleaned up] to improve their usefulness.

[examples]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/13877
[refactored]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/13905
[cleaned up]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/13950

## New Features âœ¨

There are too many new features in the last 6 months to list them all, but here
are some highlights:

### Functions
* Uniform Window Functions:  `BuiltInWindowFunctions` was removed and all now use UDFs ([@jcsherin])
* Uniform Aggregate Functions: `BuiltInAggregateFunctions` was removed and all now use UDFs
* As mentioned above function documentation was extracted from the markdown files
* Some new functions and sql support were added including '[show functions]', '[to_local_time]',
  '[regexp_count]', '[map_extract]', '[array_distance]', '[array_any_value]', '[greatest]',
  '[least]', '[arrays_overlap]'

### FFI
* Foreign Function Interface work has started. This should allow for 
  [using table providers] across languages and versions of DataFusion. This 
  is especially pertinent for integration with [delta-rs] and other table formats.

[delta-rs]: https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/

### Materialized Views
* [@suremarc] has added a [materialized view implementation] in datafusion-contrib ðŸš€

### Substrait
* A lot of work was put into improving and enhancing substrait support ([@Blizzara], [@westonpace], [@tokoko], [@vbarua], [@LatrecheYasser], [@notfilippo] and others)

## Looking Ahead: The Next Six Months ðŸ”­ 

One of the long term goals of [@alamb], DataFusion's PMC chair, has been to have 
[1000 DataFusion based projects]. This may be the year that happens!

The community has been [discussing what we will work on in the next six months].
Some major initiatives are likely to be:

1. *Performance*: A [number of items have been identified] as areas that could use additional work
2. *Memory usage*: Tracking and improving memory usage, statistics and spilling to disk 
3. *[Google Summer of Code] (GSOC)*: DataFusion is hopefully selected as a project and we start accepting and supporting student projects 
4. *FFI*: Extending the FFI implementation to support to all types of UDF's and SessionContext
5. *Spark Functions*: A [proposal has been made to add a crate] covering spark compatible builtin functions

## How to Get Involved

DataFusion is not a project built or driven by a single person, company, or
foundation. Rather, our community of users and contributors work together to
build a shared technology that none of us could have built alone.

If you are interested in joining us we would love to have you. You can try out
DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and let us know how it goes,
contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or a PR with documentation,
tests or code. A list of open issues suitable for beginners is [here] and you
can find how to reach us on the [communication doc].
