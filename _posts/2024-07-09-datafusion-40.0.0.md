## Introduction

We recently [released DataFusion 40.0.0]. This blog highlights some of the major
improvements since we [released DataFusion 34.0.0] (spoiler alert there are many)
and a preview of where the community plans to focus in the next 6 months.

<!-- todo update this intro --> 
[Apache Arrow DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion‚Äôs primary design
goal] is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library] and
[command line SQL tool].

DataFusion is very much a community endeavor. Our core thesis is that as a
community we can build much more advanced technology than any of us as
individuals or companies could alone. In the last 6 months between `26.0.0` and
`34.0.0`, community growth has been strong. We accepted and reviewed over a
thousand PRs from 124 different committers, created over 650 issues and closed 517
of them.
You can find a list of all changes in the detailed [CHANGELOG].

### Growth of DataFusion üìà


# DataFusion in 2024 ü•≥

Some major initiatives from contributors we know of this year are:

1. *Modularity*: Make DataFusion even more modular, such as [unifying
   built in and user functions], making it easier to customize 
   DataFusion's behavior.

2. *Community Growth*: Graduate to our own top level Apache project, and
   subsequently add more committers and PMC members to keep pace with project
   growth.

5. *Use case white papers*: Write blog posts and videos explaining
   how to use DataFusion for real-world use cases.

3. *Testing*: Improve CI infrastructure and test coverage, more fuzz
   testing, and better functional and performance regression testing.

3. *Planning Time*: Reduce the time taken to plan queries, both [wide
   tables of 1000s of columns], and in [general].

4. *Aggregate Performance*: Improve the speed of [aggregating "high cardinality"] data
   when there are many (e.g. millions) of distinct groups.

5. *Statistics*: [Improved statistics handling] with an eye towards more
   sophisticated expression analysis and cost models.

[aggregating "high cardinality"]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/7000

# How to Get Involved

If you are interested in contributing to DataFusion we would love to have you
join us. You can try out DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and
let us know how it goes, contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or
a PR with documentation, tests or code. A list of open issues
suitable for beginners is [here].

As the community grows, we are also looking to restart biweekly calls /
meetings. Timezones are always a challenge for such meetings, but we hope to
have two calls that can work for most attendees. If you are interested
in helping, or just want to say hi, please drop us a note via one of 
the methods listed in our [Communication Doc].
