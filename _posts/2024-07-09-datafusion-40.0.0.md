## Introduction

We recently [released DataFusion 40.0.0]. This blog highlights some of the many
major improvements since we [released DataFusion 34.0.0]
and a preview of where the community is thinking about improving in the next 6 months.

[released DataFusion 34.0.0]: https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/01/19/datafusion-34.0.0/
[released DataFusion 40.0.0]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion/40.0.0

<!-- todo update this intro --> 
[Apache Arrow DataFusion] is an extensible query engine, written in [Rust], that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion is used by developers to
create new, fast data centric systems such as databases, dataframe libraries,
machine learning and streaming applications. While [DataFusion‚Äôs primary design
goal] is to accelerate creating other data centric systems, it has a
reasonable experience directly out of the box as a [dataframe library] and
[command line SQL tool].

[DataFusion‚Äôs primary design goal]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html#project-goals
[dataframe library]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/
[command line SQL tool]: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/cli.html

DataFusion's core thesis is that as a community together, we can build much more
advanced technology than any of us as individuals or companies could do alone. 
Without DataFusion, highly performant vectorized query engines would remain
the domain of a few large companies and world-class research institutions. 
With DataFusion, we can all build on top of a shared foundation, and focus on
what makes our projects unique.




# Community Growth  üìà 

In the last 6 months between `34.0.0` and `40.0.0`, our community continues to
grow in new ane exciting ways.

1. DataFusion became a top level Apache Software Foundation project (read the
   [press release] and [blog post]).
2. [DataFusion Comet] was [donated] and is nearing its first release.
3. In the [core DataFusion repo] alone We accepted and reviewed almost 1500 PRs from 182 different
   committers, created over 1000 issues and closed 781 of them üöÄ. This is up from
   1000 PRs from 124 committers with 650 issues created in our last post ü§Ø. You
   can find a list of all changes in the detailed [CHANGELOG].
3. DataFusion meetups in multiple cities around the world: [Austin], [San Francisco], [Hangzhou], [New York], and [Belgrade].

In addition, DataFusion has been appearing in more and more writing, both online and offline. Here are some highlights:

1. [Apache Arrow DataFusion: A Fast, Embeddable, Modular Analytic Query Engine], was presented in [SIGMOD '24], one of the major database conferences
2. DataFusion described as part of the trend to define "the POSIX of databases" in ["What Goes Around Comes Around... And Around...] from Andy Pavlo and Mike Stonebraker
3. ["Why you should keep an eye on Apache DataFusion and its community"]
4. [Apache DataFusion offline meetup in the Bay Area]

# Improved Performance üöÄ 

Performance is a key feature of DataFusion, DataFusion is 

TODO: Planning speed improvements: 

Implement specialized group values for single Uft8/LargeUtf8/Binary/LargeBinary column #8827


https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/8827

## In progress
StringView (TODO get links)



# Improved quality

TODO mention the SQLancer: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/11030




# New Features ‚ú®

Improvements: unnest, null handling improvements for lead/lag

## 

## TreeNode API


## Other Features

Recursive CTEs https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/9619 / https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/462

# Building Systems is Easier with DataFusion üõ†Ô∏è

Large scale "extract scalar functions from the core": all scalar functions are now exactly the same API as built in https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/9285

We are close to completing the same treatment for aggregates and then window functions

SQL to String (both exprs and plans): https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/9494

WASM builds: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/discussions/9834

## Documentation
It is easier than ever to get started using DataFusion with the
new [Library Users Guide] as well as significantly improved the [API documentation]. 

[Library Users Guide]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/index.html
[API documentation]: https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/index.html

# SQL Unparser 

This feature allows you to convert logical plans and exprs back to SQL text

This can be useful for federation, and for building systems that generate SQL
https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/sql/unparser/fn.expr_to_sql.html

TODO more doc ideas from https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/11395

## User Defined SQL Extensiions

## Support for `CREATE FUNCTION`
https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/9333

Let's you build systems that support user defined functions

Huge thanks to [@milenkovicm](https://github.com/milenkovicm)

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION my_func(DOUBLE, DOUBLE)
    RETURNS DOUBLE
    RETURN $1 $3
"#;
```

And

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION iris(FLOAT[])
RETURNS FLOAT[]
LANGUAGE TORCH
AS 'models:/iris@champion'
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION func(FLOAT[])
RETURNS FLOAT[]
LANGUAGE WASM
AS 'func.wasm'
```

BTW it would be great if someone made a demo showing how to do this (see https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/9326 )


## Parquet indexing / low latency queries

We used the Parquet indexing feature (`ParquetAccessPlan`) to add [efficient support] for reading from DeltaLake tables and handling [deletion vectors]. I think its a cool use-case for the indexing feature and perhaps worth calling out as an example of a real-world use-case.

[efficient support]: https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/pull/1891
[deletion vectors]: https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html



# DataFusion in 2dn half 2024 ü•≥

Some major initiatives from contributors we know of this year are:

1. *Modularity*: Make DataFusion even more modular, such as [unifying
   built in and user functions], making it easier to customize 
   DataFusion's behavior.

2. *Community Growth*: Graduate to our own top level Apache project, and
   subsequently add more committers and PMC members to keep pace with project
   growth.

5. *Use case white papers*: Write blog posts and videos explaining
   how to use DataFusion for real-world use cases.

3. *Testing*: Improve CI infrastructure and test coverage, more fuzz
   testing, and better functional and performance regression testing.

3. *Planning Time*: Reduce the time taken to plan queries, both [wide
   tables of 1000s of columns], and in [general].

4. *Aggregate Performance*: Improve the speed of [aggregating "high cardinality"] data
   when there are many (e.g. millions) of distinct groups.

5. *Statistics*: [Improved statistics handling] with an eye towards more
   sophisticated expression analysis and cost models.

# How to Get Involved

If you are interested in contributing to DataFusion we would love to have you
join us. You can try out DataFusion on some of your own data and projects and
let us know how it goes, contribute suggestions, documentation, bug reports, or
a PR with documentation, tests or code. A list of open issues
suitable for beginners is [here].

As the community grows, we are also looking to restart biweekly calls /
meetings. Timezones are always a challenge for such meetings, but we hope to
have two calls that can work for most attendees. If you are interested
in helping, or just want to say hi, please drop us a note via one of 
the methods listed in our [Communication Doc].
