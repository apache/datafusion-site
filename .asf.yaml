# Publishes the content of the `asf-site` branch to

# Automatically builds branches matching `site/*`
# and pushes the output to `site/<name>-staging`.
# For example, `site/foo` â†’ `site/foo-staging`

# Automatically stages the output of autobuild branches.
# For example:
#   - A push to `site/foo` triggers an autobuild to `site/foo-staging`
#   - `site/foo-staging` matches the `autostage` pattern
#   - The site is then staged at: https://datafusion-foo.staged.apache.org
