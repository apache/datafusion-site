<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>TLDR; <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> DataFusion --&gt; <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a></p>
<p>The Arrow PMC and newly created DataFusion PMC are happy to announce that as of
April 16, 2024 the Apache Arrow DataFusion subproject is now a top level
<a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> project.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Apache DataFusion is a fast, extensible query engine for building high-quality
data-centric systems in Rust, using the Apache Arrow in-memory format.</p>
<p>When DataFusion was <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/">donated to the Apache Software Foundation</a> in 2019, the
DataFusion community was not large enough to stand on its own and the Arrow
project agreed to help support it. The community has grown significantly since
2019, benefiting immensely from being part of Arrow and following <a href="https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/">The Apache
Way</a>.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>The community <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/discussions/6475">discussed graduating to a top level project publicly</a> for almost
a year, as the project seemed ready to stand on its own and would benefit from
more focused governance. For example, earlier in DataFusion's life many
contributed to both <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs">arrow-rs</a> and DataFusion, but as DataFusion has matured many
contributors, committers and PMC members focused more and more exclusively on
DataFusion.</p>
<h2>Looking forward</h2>
<p>The future looks bright. There are now <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#known-users">10s of known projects built with
DataFusion</a>, and that number continues to grow. We recently held our <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/discussions/8522">first in
person meetup</a> passed <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/stargazers">5000 stars</a> on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/8373#issuecomment-2025133714">wrote a paper that was accepted
at SIGMOD 2024</a>, and began work on <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet">Comet</a>, an <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> accelerator
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2024/03/06/comet-donation/">initially donated by Apple</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in the Arrow community who helped DataFusion grow and
mature over the years, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration as
projects. All future blogs and announcements will be posted on the <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache
DataFusion</a> website.</p>
<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>If you are interested in joining the community, we would love to have you join
