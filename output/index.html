<h2>Personal Context</h2>
<p>For a few months now I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a>, a
fast query engine written in Rust. From my experience the language that nearly all data scientists
are working in is Python. In general, data scientists often use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
for in-memory tasks and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">PySpark</a> for larger …</p></p>

the first time a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>-based engine holds the top spot, which has previously
