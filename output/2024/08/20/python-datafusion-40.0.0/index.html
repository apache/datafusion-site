<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/datafusion/40.1.0/">DataFusion in Python 40.1.0</a> has been released. In addition to
bringing in all of the new features of the core <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/07/24/datafusion-40.0.0/">DataFusion 40.0.0</a> package, this release
contains <em>significant</em> updates to the user interface and documentation. We listened to the python
user community to create a more <em>pythonic</em> experience. If you have not used the python interface to
DataFusion before, this is an excellent time to give it a try!</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Until now, the python bindings for DataFusion have primarily been a thin layer to expose the
underlying Rust functionality. This has been worked well for early adopters to use DataFusion
within their Python projects, but some users have found it difficult to work with. As compared to
other DataFrame libraries, these issues were raised:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the functions had little or no documentation. Users often had to refer to the Rust
documentation or code to learn how to use DataFusion. This alienated some python users.</li>
<li>Users could not take advantage of modern IDE features such as type hinting. These are valuable
tools for rapid testing and development.</li>
<li>Some of the interfaces felt &ldquo;clunky&rdquo; to users since some Python concepts do not always map well
to their Rust counterparts.</li>
</ol>
<p>This release aims to bring a better user experience to the DataFusion Python community.</p>
<h2>What's Changed</h2>
<p>The most significant difference is that we have added wrapper functions and classes for most of the
user facing interface. These wrappers, written in Python, contain both documentation and type
annotations.</p>
<p>This documenation is now available on the <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/python/autoapi/datafusion/index.html">DataFusion in Python API</a> website. There you can browse
the available functions and classes to see the breadth of available functionality.</p>
<p>Modern IDEs use language servers such as
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance">Pylance</a> or
<a href="https://jedi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jedi</a> to perform analysis of python code, provide useful
hints, and identify usage errors. These are major tools in the python user community. With this
release, users can fully use these tools in their workflow.</p>

<p>By having the type annotations, these IDEs can also identify quickly when a user has incorrectly
used a function's arguments as shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>In addition to these wrapper libraries, we have enhancements to some of the functions to feel more
easy to use.</p>
<h3>Improved DataFrame filter arguments</h3>
<p>You can now apply multiple <code>filter</code> statements in a single step. When using <code>DataFrame.filter</code> you
can pass in multiple arguments, separated by a comma. These will act as a logical <code>AND</code> of all of
the filter arguments. The following two statements are equivalent:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"size"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"max_size"</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"color"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"size"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"max_size"</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"color"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Comparison against literal values</h3>
<p>It is very common to write DataFrame operations that compare an expression to some fixed value.
For example, filtering a DataFrame might have an operation such as <code>df.filter(col("size") &lt; lit(16))</code>.
To make these common operations more ergonomic, you can now simply use <code>df.filter(col("size") &lt; 16)</code>.</p>
<p>For the right hand side of the comparison operator, you can now use any Python value that can be
coerced into a <code>Literal</code>. This gives an easy to ready expression. For example, consider these few
lines from one of the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/tree/main/examples/tpch">TPC-H examples</a> provided in
the DataFusion Python repository.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">df_lineitem</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_shipdate"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_discount"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DISCOUNT</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DELTA</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_discount"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DISCOUNT</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DELTA</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_quantity"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">lit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">QUANTITY</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above code mirrors closely how these filters would need to be applied in rust. With this new
release, the user can simplify these lines. Also shown in the example below is that <code>filter()</code>
now accepts a variable number of arguments and filters on all such arguments (boolean AND).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df_lineitem</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_shipdate"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_discount"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">DISCOUNT</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">DELTA</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_discount"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">DISCOUNT</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">DELTA</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"l_quantity"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">QUANTITY</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Select columns by name</h3>
<p>It is very common for users to perform <code>DataFrame</code> selection where they simply want a column. For
this we have had the function <code>select_columns("a", "b")</code> or the user could perform
<code>select(col("a"), col("b"))</code>. In the new release, we accept either full expressions in <code>select()</code>
or strings of the column names. You can mix these as well.</p>
<p>Where before you may have to do an operation like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df_subset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"b"</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"c"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can now simplify this to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df_subset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"b"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"c"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Creating named structs</h3>
<p>Creating a <code>struct</code> with named fields was previously difficult to use and allowed for potential
user errors when specifying the name of each field. Now we have a cleaner interface where the
user passes a list of tuples containing the name of the field and the expression to create.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">named_struct</span><span class="p">([</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="p">)),</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"b"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"b"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">]))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>While most of the user facing classes and functions have been exposed, there are a few that require
exposure. Namely the classes in <code>datafusion.object_store</code> and the logical plans used by
<code>datafusion.substrait</code>. The team is working on
<a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/issues/767">these issues</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the next release of DataFusion there have been improvements made to the user-defined
aggregate and window functions to make them easier to use. We plan on
<a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/issues/780">bringing these enhancements</a> to this project.</p>
