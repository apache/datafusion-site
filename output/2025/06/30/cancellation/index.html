<p>Have you ever tried to cancel a query that just wouldn't stop?
In this post, we'll review how Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-00-async-await.html"><code>async</code> programming model</a> works, how <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">DataFusion</a> uses that model for CPU intensive tasks, and how this is used to cancel queries.
Then we'll review some cases where queries could not be canceled in DataFusion and what the community did to resolve the problem.</p>
<h2>Understanding Rust's Async Model</h2>
<p>DataFusion, somewhat unconventionally, <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/#thread-scheduling-cpu--io-thread-pools-and-tokio-runtimes">uses the Rust async system and the Tokio task scheduler</a> for CPU intensive processing.
To really understand the cancellation problem you first need to be familiar with Rust's asynchronous programming model which is a bit different from what you might be used to from other ecosystems.
Let's go over the basics again as a refresher.
If you're familiar with the ins and outs of <code>Future</code> and <code>async</code> you can skip this section.</p>
<h3>Futures Are Inert</h3>
<p>Rust's asynchronous programming model is built around the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future&lt;T&gt;</code></a> trait.
In contrast to, for instance, Javascript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"><code>Promise</code></a> or Java's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Future.html"><code>Future</code></a> a Rust <code>Future</code> does not necessarily represent an actively running asynchronous job.
Instead, a <code>Future&lt;T&gt;</code> represents a lazy calculation that only makes progress when explicitly asked to do so.
This is done by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll"><code>poll</code></a> method of a <code>Future</code>.
If nobody polls a <code>Future</code> explicitly, it is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html#runtime-characteristics">an inert object</a>.</p>
<p>Calling <code>Future::poll</code> results in one of two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Pending"><code>Poll::Pending</code></a> if the evaluation is not yet complete, most often because it needs to wait for something like I/O before it can continue</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Ready"><code>Poll::Ready&lt;T&gt;</code></a> when it has completed and produced a value</li>
</ul>
<p>When a <code>Future</code> returns <code>Pending</code>, it saves its internal state so it can pick up where it left off the next time you poll it.
This internal state management makes Rust's <code>Future</code>s memory-efficient and composable.
Rather than freezing the full call stack leading to a certain point, only the relevant state to resume the future needs to be retained.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <code>Future</code> must set up the necessary signaling to notify the caller when it should call <code>poll</code> again, to avoid a busy-waiting loop.
This is done using a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/struct.Waker.html"><code>Waker</code></a> which the <code>Future</code> receives via the <code>Context</code> parameter of the <code>poll</code> function. </p>
<p>Manual implementations of <code>Future</code> are most often little finite state machines.
Each state in the process of completing the calculation is modeled as a variant of an <code>enum</code>.
Before a <code>Future</code> returns <code>Pending</code>, it bundles the data required to resume in an enum variant, stores that enum variant in itself, and then returns.
While compact and efficient, the resulting code is often quite verbose.</p>
<p>The <code>async</code> keyword was introduced to make life easier on Rust programmers.
It provides elegant syntactic sugar for the manual state machine <code>Future</code> approach.
When you write an <code>async</code> function or block, the compiler transforms linear code into a state machine based <code>Future</code> similar to the one described above for you.
Since all the state management is compiler generated and hidden from sight, async code tends to be easier to write initially, more readable afterward, while maintaining the same underlying mechanics.</p>
<p>The <code>await</code> keyword complements <code>async</code> pausing execution until a <code>Future</code> completes. <br/>
When you <code>.await</code> a <code>Future</code>, you're essentially telling the compiler to generate code that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Polls the <code>Future</code> with the current (implicit) asynchronous context</li>
<li>If <code>poll</code> returns <code>Poll::Pending</code>, save the state of the <code>Future</code> so that it can resume at this point and return <code>Poll::Pending</code></li>
<li>If it returns <code>Poll::Ready(value)</code>, continue execution with that value</li>
</ol>
<h3>From Futures to Streams</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/"><code>futures</code></a> crate extends the <code>Future</code> model with a trait named <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/trait.Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a>.
<code>Stream&lt;Item = T&gt;</code> represents a sequence of values that are each produced asynchronously rather than just a single value.
It's the asynchronous equivalent of <code>Iterator&lt;Item = T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> trait has one method named <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/trait.Stream.html#tymethod.poll_next"><code>poll_next</code></a> that returns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Poll::Pending</code> when the next value isn't ready yet, just like a <code>Future</code> would</li>
<li><code>Poll::Ready(Some(value))</code> when a new value is available</li>
<li><code>Poll::Ready(None)</code> when the stream is exhausted</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the hood, an implementation of <code>Stream</code> is very similar to a <code>Future</code>.
Typically, they're also implemented as state machines, the main difference being that they produce multiple values rather than just one.
Just like <code>Future</code>, a <code>Stream</code> is inert unless explicitly polled.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the basics of Rust's async model, let's see how DataFusion leverages these concepts to execute queries.</p>
<h2>How DataFusion Executes Queries</h2>
<p>In DataFusion, the short version of how queries are executed is as follows (you can find more in-depth coverage of this in the <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/#streaming-execution">DataFusion documentation</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>First the query is compiled into a tree of <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/trait.ExecutionPlan.html"><code>ExecutionPlan</code></a> nodes</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/trait.ExecutionPlan.html#tymethod.execute"><code>ExecutionPlan::execute</code></a> is called on the root of the tree. </li>
<li>This method returns a <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/execution/type.SendableRecordBatchStream.html"><code>SendableRecordBatchStream</code></a> (a pinned <code>Box&lt;dyn Stream&lt;RecordBatch&gt;&gt;</code>)</li>
<li><code>Stream::poll_next</code> is called in a loop to get the results</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the execution of a DataFusion query boils down to polling an asynchronous stream.
Like all <code>Stream</code> implementations, we need to explicitly poll the stream for the query to make progress. </p>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> we get in step 2 is actually the root of a tree of <code>Streams</code> that mostly mirrors the execution plan tree.
Each stream tree node processes the record batches it gets from its children.
The leaves of the tree produce record batches themselves.</p>
<p>Query execution progresses each time you call <code>poll_next</code> on the root stream.
This call typically cascades down the tree, with each node calling <code>poll_next</code> on its children to get the data it needs to process.</p>
<p>Here's where the first signs of problems start to show up: some operations (like aggregations, sorts, or certain join phases) need to process a lot of data before producing any output.
When <code>poll_next</code> encounters one of these operations, it might require substantial work before it can return a record batch.</p>
<h3>Tokio and Cooperative Scheduling</h3>
<p>We need to make a small detour now via Tokio's scheduler before we can get to the query cancellation problem.
DataFusion makes use of the <a href="https://tokio.rs">Tokio asynchronous runtime</a>, which uses a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/index.html#what-are-tasks">cooperative scheduling model</a>.
This is fundamentally different from preemptive scheduling that you might be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>preemptive scheduling</strong>, the system can interrupt a task at any time to run something else</li>
<li>In <strong>cooperative scheduling</strong>, tasks must voluntarily yield control back to the scheduler</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction is crucial for understanding our cancellation problem.</p>
<p>A task in Tokio is modeled as a <code>Future</code> which is passed to one of the task initiation functions like <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/fn.spawn.html"><code>spawn</code></a>.
Tokio runs the task by calling <code>Future::poll</code> in a loop until it returns <code>Poll::Ready</code>.
While that <code>Future::poll</code> call is running, Tokio has no way to forcibly interrupt it.
It must cooperate by periodically yielding control, either by returning <code>Poll::Pending</code> or <code>Poll::Ready</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you try to abort a task by calling <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.abort"><code>JoinHandle::abort()</code></a>, the Tokio runtime can't immediately force it to stop.
You're just telling Tokio: "When this task next yields control, don't call <code>Future::poll</code> anymore."
If the task never yields, it can't be aborted.</p>
<h3>The Cancellation Problem</h3>
<p>With all the necessary background in place, now let's look at how the DataFusion CLI tries to run and cancel a query.
The code below is a simplified version of <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/db13dd93579945628cd81d534c032f5e6cc77967/datafusion-cli/src/exec.rs#L179-L186">what the CLI actually does</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn exec_query() {
    let runtime: tokio::runtime::Runtime = ...;
    let stream: SendableRecordBatchStream = ...;

    runtime.block_on(async {
        tokio::select! {
            next_batch = stream.next() =&gt; ...
            _ = signal::ctrl_c() =&gt; ...,
        }
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>First the CLI sets up a Tokio runtime instance.
It then reads the query to execute from standard input or file and turns it into a <code>Stream</code>.
Then it calls <code>next</code> on stream which is an <code>async</code> wrapper for <code>poll_next</code>.
It passes this to the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/macro.select.html"><code>select!</code></a> macro along with a ctrl-C handler.</p>
<p>The <code>select!</code> macro races these two <code>Future</code>s and completes when either one finishes.
The intent is that when you press Ctrl+C, the <code>signal::ctrl_c()</code> <code>Future</code> should complete.
The <a href="https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/physical_plan/trait.ExecutionPlan.html#cancellation--aborting-execution">stream is cancelled</a> when it is dropped as it is inert by itself and nothing will be able to call <code>poll_next</code> again.</p>
<p>But there's a catch: <code>select!</code> still follows cooperative scheduling rules.
It polls each <code>Future</code> in sequence, and if the first one (our query) gets stuck in a long computation, it never gets around to polling the cancellation signal.</p>
<p>Imagine a query that needs to calculate something intensive, like sorting billions of rows.
Unless the sorting Stream is written with care (which the one in DataFusion is), the <code>poll_next</code> call may take several minutes or even longer without returning.
During this time, Tokio can't check if you've pressed Ctrl+C, and the query continues running despite your cancellation request.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look at Blocking Operators</h2>
<p>Let's peel back a layer of the onion and look at what's happening in a blocking <code>poll_next</code> implementation.
Here's a drastically simplified version of a <code>COUNT(*)</code> aggregation - something you might use in a query like <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct BlockingStream {
    // the input: an inner stream that is wrapped
    stream: SendableRecordBatchStream,
    count: usize,
    finished: bool,
}

impl Stream for BlockingStream {
    type Item = Result&lt;RecordBatch&gt;;
    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {
        if self.finished {
            // return None if we're finished
            return Poll::Ready(None);
        }

        loop {
            // poll the input stream to get the next batch if ready
            match ready!(self.stream.poll_next_unpin(cx)) {
                // increment the counter if we got a batch
                Some(Ok(batch)) =&gt; self.count += batch.num_rows(),
                // on end-of-stream, create a record batch for the counter
                None =&gt; {
                    self.finished = true;
                    return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(create_record_batch(self.count))));
                }
                // pass on any errors verbatim
                Some(Err(e)) =&gt; return Poll::Ready(Some(Err(e))),
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>How does this code work? Let's break it down step by step:</p>
<p><strong>1. Initial check</strong>: We first check if we've already finished processing. If so, we return <code>Ready(None)</code> to signal the end of our stream:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">if self.finished {
    return Poll::Ready(None);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Processing loop</strong>: If we're not done yet, we enter a loop to process incoming batches from our input stream:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">loop {
    match ready!(self.stream.poll_next_unpin(cx)) {
        // Handle different cases...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/task/macro.ready.html"><code>ready!</code></a> macro checks if the input stream returned <code>Pending</code> and if so, immediately returns <code>Pending</code> from our function as well.</p>
<p><strong>3. Processing data</strong>: For each batch we receive, we simply add its row count to our running total:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">Some(Ok(batch)) =&gt; self.count += batch.num_rows(),
</code></pre>
<p><strong>4. End of input</strong>: When the child stream is exhausted (returns <code>None</code>), we calculate our final result and convert it into a record batch (omitted for brevity):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">None =&gt; {
    self.finished = true;
    return Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(create_record_batch(self.count))));
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>5. Error handling</strong>: If we encounter an error, we pass it along immediately:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">Some(Err(e)) =&gt; return Poll::Ready(Some(Err(e))),
</code></pre>
<p>This code looks perfectly reasonable at first glance.
But there's a subtle issue lurking here: what happens if the input stream <em>always</em> returns <code>Ready</code> and never returns <code>Pending</code>?</p>
<p>In that case, the processing loop will keep running without returning <code>Poll::Pending</code> and thus never yield control back to Tokio's scheduler.
This means we could be stuck in a single <code>poll_next</code> call for quite some time - exactly the scenario that prevents query cancellation from working!</p>
<p>So how do we solve this problem? Let's explore some strategies to ensure our operators yield control periodically.</p>
<h2>Unblocking Operators</h2>
<p>Now let's look at how we can ensure we return <code>Pending</code> every now and then.</p>
<h3>Independent Cooperative Operators</h3>
<p>One simple way to return <code>Pending</code> is using a loop counter.
We do the exact same thing as before, but on each loop iteration we decrement our counter.
If the counter hits zero we return <code>Pending</code>.
The following example ensures we iterate at most 128 times before yielding.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct CountingSourceStream {
   counter: usize
}

impl Stream for CountingSourceStream {
    type Item = Result&lt;RecordBatch&gt;;

    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {
        if self.counter &gt;= 128 {
            self.counter = 0;
            cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
            return Poll::Pending;
        }

        self.counter += 1;
        let batch = ...;
        Ready(Some(Ok(batch)))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>CountingSourceStream</code> was the input for the <code>BlockingStream</code> example above, 
the <code>BlockingStream</code> will receive a <code>Pending</code> periodically causing it to yield too. 
Can we really solve the cancel problem simply by periodically yielding in source streams? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no.
Let's look at what happens when we start combining operators in more complex configurations.
Suppose we create a plan like this.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Diagram showing a plan that merges two branches that return Pending at different intervals." src="/blog/images/task-cancellation/merge_plan.png"/>
<figcaption>A plan that merges two branches by alternating between them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each <code>CountingSource</code> produces a <code>Pending</code> every 128 batches.
The <code>Filter</code> is a stream that drops a batch every 50 record batches.
Merge is a simple combining operator the uses <code>futures::stream::select</code> to combine two stream.</p>
<p>When we set this stream in motion, the merge operator will poll the left and right branch in a round-robin fashion.
The sources will each emit <code>Pending</code> every 128 batches, but since the <code>Filter</code> drops batches, they arrive out-of-phase at the merge operator.
As a consequence the merge operator will always have the opportunity of polling the other stream when one returns <code>Pending</code>.
The <code>Merge</code> stream thus is an always ready stream, even though the sources are yielding.
If we use <code>Merge</code> as the input to our aggregating operator we're right back where we started.</p>
<h3>Coordinated Cooperation</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if we could get all the operators to coordinate amongst each other?
When one of them determines that it's time to yield, all the other operators agree and start returning <code>Pending</code> as well.
That way our task would be coaxed towards yielding even if it tried to poll many different operators.</p>
<p>Luckily(?), the <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2020-04-preemption">developers of Tokio ran into the exact same problem</a> described above when network servers were under heavy load and came up with a solution.
Back in 2020, Tokio 0.2.14 introduced a per-task operation budget.
Rather than having individual counters littered throughout the code, the Tokio runtime itself manages a per task counter which is decremented by Tokio resources.
When the counter hits zero, all resources start returning <code>Pending</code>.
The task will then yield, after which the Tokio runtime resets the counter.</p>
<p>To illustrate what this process looks like, let's have a look at the execution of the following query <code>Stream</code> tree when polled in a Tokio task.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Diagram showing a plan with a task, AggregateExec, MergeStream and Two sources." src="/blog/images/task-cancellation/tokio_budget_plan.png">
<figcaption>Query plan for aggregating a sorted stream from two sources. Each source reads a stream of `RecordBatch`es, which are then merged into a single Stream by the `MergeStream` operator which is then aggregated by the `AggregateExec` operator. Arrows represent the data flow direction</figcaption>
</img></figure>
<p>If we assume a task budget of 1 unit, each time Tokio schedules the task would result in the following sequence of function calls.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Sequence diagram showing how the tokio task budget is used and reset." class="img-responsive" src="/blog/images/task-cancellation/tokio_budget.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%"/>
<figcaption>Tokio task budget system, assuming the task budget is set to 1, for the plan above.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The aggregation stream would try to poll the merge stream in a loop.
The first iteration of the loop consumes the single unit of budget, and returns <code>Ready</code>.
The second iteration polls the merge stream again which now tries to poll the second scan stream.
Since there is no budget remaining <code>Pending</code> is returned.
The merge stream may now try to poll the first source stream again, but since the budget is still depleted <code>Pending</code> is returned as well.
The merge stream now has no other option than to return <code>Pending</code> itself as well, causing the aggregation to break out of its loop.
The <code>Pending</code> result bubbles all the way up to the Tokio runtime, at which point the runtime regains control.
When the runtime reschedules the task, it resets the budget and calls <code>poll</code> on the task <code>Future</code> again for another round of progress.</p>
<p>The key mechanism that makes this work well is the single task budget that's shared amongst all the scan streams.
Once the budget is depleted, no streams can make any further progress without first returning control to tokio.
This causes all possible avenues the task has to make progress to return <code>Pending</code> which results in the task being nudged towards yielding control.</p>
<p>As it turns out DataFusion was already using this mechanism implicitly.
Every exchange-like operator (such as <code>RepartitionExec</code>) internally makes use of a Tokio multiple producer, single consumer <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels"><code>Channel</code></a>.
When calling <code>Receiver::recv</code> for one of these channels, a unit of Tokio task budget is consumed.
As a consequence, query plans that made use of exchange-like operators were
already mostly cancelable.
The plan cancellation bug only showed up when running parts of plans without such operators, such as when using a single core.</p>
<p>Now let's see how we can explicitly implement this budget-based approach in our own operators.</p>
<h3>Depleting The Tokio Budget</h3>
<p>Let's revisit our original <code>BlockingStream</code> and adapt it to use Tokio's budget system.</p>
<p>The examples given here make use of functions from the Tokio <code>coop</code> module that are still internal at the time of writing.
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/7405">PR #7405</a> on the Tokio project will make these accessible for external use.
The current DataFusion code emulates these functions as well as possible using <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/coop/fn.has_budget_remaining.html"><code>has_budget_remaining</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/coop/fn.consume_budget.html"><code>consume_budget</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct BudgetSourceStream {
}

impl Stream for BudgetSourceStream {
    type Item = Result&lt;RecordBatch&gt;;

    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; {
        let coop = ready!(tokio::task::coop::poll_proceed(cx));
        let batch: Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; = ...;
        if batch.is_ready() {
            coop.made_progress();
        }
        batch
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Stream</code> now goes through the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. Try to consume budget</strong>: the first thing the operator does is use <code>poll_proceed</code> to try to consume a unit of budget.
If the budget is depleted, this function will return <code>Pending</code>.
Otherwise, we consumed one budget unit and we can continue.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let coop = ready!(tokio::task::coop::poll_proceed(cx));
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Try to do some work</strong>: next we try to produce a record batch.
That might not be possible if we're reading from some asynchronous resource that's not ready.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let batch: Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt; = ...;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Commit the budget consumption</strong>: finally, if we did produce a batch, we need to tell Tokio that we were able to make progress.</p>
<p>That's done by calling the <code>made_progress</code> method on the value <code>poll_proceed</code> returned.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">if batch.is_ready() {
   coop.made_progress();
}
</code></pre>
<p>You might be wondering why the call to <code>made_progress</code> is necessary.
This clever construct makes it easier to manage the budget.
The value returned by <code>poll_proceed</code> will actually restore the budget to its original value when it is dropped unless <code>made_progress</code> is called.
This ensures that if we exit early from our <code>poll_next</code> implementation by returning <code>Pending</code>, that the budget we had consumed becomes available again.
The task that invoked <code>poll_next</code> can then use that budget again to try to make some other <code>Stream</code> (or any resource for that matter) make progress.</p>
<h2>Automatic Cooperation For All Operators</h2>
<p>DataFusion 49.0.0  integrates the Tokio task budget based fix in all built-in source operators.
This ensures that going forward, most queries will automatically be cancelable. 
See <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16398">the PR</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The design includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A new <code>ExecutionPlan</code> property that indicates if an operator participates in cooperative scheduling or not.</li>
<li>A new <code>EnsureCooperative</code> optimizer rule to inspect query plans and insert <code>CooperativeExec</code> nodes as needed to ensure custom source operators also participate.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two changes combined already make it very unlikely you'll encounter any query that refuses to stop, even with custom operators.
For those situations where the automatic mechanisms are still not sufficient, there's a new <code>datafusion::physical_plan::coop</code> module
with utility functions that make it easy to adopt cooperative scheduling in your custom operators as well.  </p>

<h2>About DataFusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a> is an extensible query engine toolkit, written
in Rust, that uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> as its in-memory format. DataFusion and
similar technology are part of the next generation &ldquo;Deconstructed Database&rdquo;
architectures, where new systems are built on a foundation of fast, modular
components, rather than as a single tightly integrated system.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/communication.html">DataFusion community</a> is always looking for new contributors to help
improve the project. If you are interested in learning more about how query
execution works, help document or improve the DataFusion codebase, or just try
it out, we would love for you to join us.</p>
