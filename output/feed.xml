&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a common misconception that &lt;a href="https://parquet.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Parquet&lt;/a&gt; files are limited to basic Min/Max/Null Count statistics and Bloom filters, and that adding more advanced indexes requires changing the specification or creating a new file format. In fact, footer metadata and offset-based addressing already provide everything needed to embed â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Qi Zhu (Cloudera), Jigao Luo (Systems Group at TU Darmstadt), and Andrew Lamb (InfluxData)</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:datafusion.apache.org,2025-07-14:/blog/2025/07/14/user-defined-parquet-indexes</guid><category>blog</category></item><item><title>Apache DataFusion 47.0.0 Released</title><link>https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/07/11/datafusion-47.0.0</link><description>&lt;!--

&lt;p&gt;Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL, allowing for complex analytical computations over a subset of data. However, efficiently implementing them, especially sliding windows, can be quite challenging. With &lt;a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/"&gt;Apache DataFusion&lt;/a&gt;'s user-defined window functions, developers can easily take advantage of all the effort put into DataFusion's implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
