<p>Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL, allowing for complex analytical computations over a subset of data. However, efficiently implementing them, especially sliding windows, can be quite challenging. With <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/">Apache DataFusion</a>'s user-defined window functions, developers can easily take advantage of all the effort put into DataFusion's implementation.</p>
